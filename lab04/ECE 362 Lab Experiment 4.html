    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Microprocessors consistently follow a straight sequence of
      instructions, and it is likely that you have only worked with this kind of
      programming until now.  In this experiment, you will configure a
      microprocessor to handle exceptional events.  These events will
      be generated in an expected manner, but the principles are the
      same for failures, faults, and other unexpected events.  These
      events will invoke Exception Handlers that you write.  These
      Exception Handlers will efficiently respond to events only when
      needed and will not run continually.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructional Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>More assembly language practice</li>
      <li>Learn about the SysTick and External GPIO interrupts (EXTI) of a microcontroller</li>
      <li>Implement Interrupt Service Routines</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Background">Step 1: Background</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Interrupts and Event-Driven Programming</h3>

    <p>
      An exception handler (or interrupt service routine) is a
      hardware-invoked subroutine.  There are many types of events
      that can be configured to generate exceptions.  When these
      events constitute failures, this type of programming is valuable
      for error handling and fault recovery.  More often, we create
      exception handlers to deal with things we want to occur
      occasionally, and that we do not want to force the
      microprocessor to continually poll (check on repeatedly).  This is called
      event-driven programming.  Here, the event in question is
      expected to be handled quickly and only occasionally.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is, arguably, the most important rule about interrupt
      handlers.  They should be <b>short</b>, do only what is
      essential, and return as soon as possible.
    </p>

    
    <h2 id="Experiment">2.0 Experiment</h2>

    <p>
      In this lab experiment, you will use the <em>simplest</em>
      interrupt source that can be configured, the SysTick interrupt.
      You will also use the interrupt source that is most easy to
      understand, the external GPIO interrupt.  Although it is
      conceptually simple (press a button to invoke a subroutine),
      the steps needed to configure it are numerous, and they are
      difficult to accomplish by a novice reading of the manual.  You
      will do these things in steps that are carefully documented.  Later,
      you will be able to modify the system to do other interesting things.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should use the same external parts that you wired to the
      microcontroller in lab 3.  In particular, the debounced buttons
      connected to PB0 and PB4 will be important for this lab.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create a project in SystemWorkbench called "lab4", and delete
      the automatically-generated main.c file.  Create a main.s file
      in the src directory.  In order to expedite setting up the
      framework for the code you will write, as well as getting all of
      the constants you will need throughout the lab,
      a <em>template</em> file for main.s is provided for you.  You should
      download <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/lab/lab4/main.s">main.s</a> and copy
      the contents into your own lab4/src/main.s file to get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experiment uses a pre-compiled object file that contains
      test functions to automatically test the subroutines you write
      for this lab.  It is called autotest.o.  To incorporate it into
      your System Workbench project, follow the instructions in the
      <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs">ECE 362 References</a> page
      for <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs/eclipse/pre-compiled-module.html">Adding
        a pre-compiled module to a project in System Workbench</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nano_wait">2.1 Setting up a long-running program</h3>
    <p>
      In this experiment, we want to model a case where the CPU has
      something to work on rather than just sit idly.  We'll
      do this with the very simple <b>nano_wait</b> subroutine:
      </p><pre>        .global nano_wait
        nano_wait:
            subs r0,#83
            bgt  nano_wait
            bx lr
      </pre>

      This function is very carefully timed so that each iteration of
      the loop takes 83 nanoseconds when the CPU clock is 48 MHz.  It's
      not particularly useful, but it will keep the CPU busy for a
      predictable time.  If you call it with the value 1,000,000,000 in R0,
      it will return approximately 1 second later.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="GPIO">2.2 Implement several GPIO subroutines</h3>
    <p>
      To demonstrate the long-running function as well as the interrupts
      you will set up for this lab, you will write several GPIO subroutines
      that will be called in several places.  Each of these subroutines is
      similar to those you wrote for lab 3.  Use autotest to ensure they
      are correct before moving on.
    </p>

    <h3 id="initc">2.2.1 initc</h3>
    <p>
      Create an assembly language subroutine called
      <b><code>initc</code></b> that enables the RCC clock for GPIO
      Port C (without affecting the other clock enable bits in the
      AHBENR) and configures the appropriate pins as follows: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>PC0-PC3 as input pins with the pull down resistor enabled</li>
	<li>PC4-PC9 as output pins</li>
      </ul>
      Make sure, for this subroutine and the next one, to change <u>only</u>
      the pins specified.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="initb">2.2.2 initb</h3>
    <p>
      Create an assembly language subroutine called
      <b><code>initb</code></b> that enables the RCC clock for GPIO
      Port B (without affecting the other clock enable bits in the
      AHBENR) and configures the appropriate pins as follows: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>PB0, PB2, PB3, PB4 as input pins</li>
	<li>enable pull down resistor on PB2 and PB3</li>
	<li>PB8-PB11 as output pins</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="togglexn">2.2.4 togglexn</h3>
    <p>
      Create an assembly language subroutine named
      <b><code>togglexn</code></b> that accepts two parameters which
      are the GPIO base address and the pin number whose output is to
      be changed from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  In C, this subroutine would
      look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>      void togglexn(GPIO_TypeDef *port, int n)
      {
          port-&gt;ODR = port-&gt;ODR ^ (1 &lt;&lt; n);
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In other words, you should assume that the GPIOx base address is
      passed as the first argument (R0), and the bit to modify is
      passed as the second argument (R1).  In the example above, the
      construct "port-&gt;ODR" refers to the offset "ODR" from the base
      address "port".  This is similar to when you say "ldr [r0,#ODR]"
      with assembly language.  You'll see this often when we start
      programming peripherals in C, so you can start to get prepared
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if I wanted to toggle the PC6 pin, I would call the
      subroutine as <b><code>togglexn(GPIOC, 6)</code></b>. Or in
      assembly, this would look like:
      </p><pre>        ldr  r0, =GPIOC
	movs r1, #6
	bl togglexn
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="Testing">Testing</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have implemented each of the subroutines described so
      far, you should run your program to test that it works
      correctly.  The program should slowly blink the blue LED (LD3)
      connected to PC9.  The rate should be approximately .5 Hz.  Use
      autotest to check that your GPIO configuration subroutines are
      implemented correctly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="EXTI">2.3 External interrupts</h2>
    <p>
      The external GPIO interrupt (EXTI) mechanism allows a GPIO pin to be
      configured so that a rising edge or falling edge (or both) can
      trigger the invocation of an interrupt service routine.  The
      steps to do so are intricate, so we will first describe each step
      briefly, and later expand on each one as you write a subroutine
      to accomplish it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First, write an interrupt service routine with the proper
        name, global declaration, and Thumb configuration.  There are
        three separate ISRs to handle all EXTI interrupts.  One of
        them handles events configured for pins 0 and 1, the second
        handles events configured for pins 2 and 3, and the third
        handles events configured for pins 4 - 15.  <b>The handler for
		SysTick will be given later, but in general, 
		it will be your job to look up the names of ISRs.</b>
	<em>(Psst, they can be found in startup_stm32.s.  You can
          find them on pg. 217 of the Family Reference Manual, but
          you'll have to append _IRQHandler onto the "Acronym" though)
        </em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When any of the three ISRs is invoked, the ISR
        must <em>acknowledge</em> the interrupt source by clearing
        its <em>pending bit</em> in the EXTI_PR (pending register).
        Unless this is done, the ISR will be immediately reinvoked
        when it returns.
      </li>
      <li>
        An EXTI interrupt for a particular pin must be associated with
        a single port.  This means that, if pin PA0 is configured to
        invoke an interrupt, none of PB0, PC0, PD0, PE0, and PF0
        can be configured to do so.  Pin 0 can only be
        associated with one port.  To make that association, EXTI
        configuration registers in the SYSCFG subsystem must be
        written to select the port for a particular pin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each EXTI interrupt must be configured for a particular pin to
        respond to the rising edge of an external signal by setting
        the appropriate bit in the EXTI_RTSR (rising trigger select
        register).  It can also be configured to respond to the
        falling edge by setting the appropriate bit in the EXTI_FTSR
        (falling trigger select register).  These two registers are
        independent of each other, so a pin can be configured to
        invoke an ISR on both the rising <em>and</em> falling edges of
        a signal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each interrupt source must be <em>unmasked</em> so that the
        NVIC is notified when a pin event is detected.  This unmasking
        is done for a particular pin by setting a bit in the EXTI_IMR
        (interrupt mask register).  Writing a '1' into bit position N
        unmasks EXTI interrupt for pin N.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, the NVIC must be configured to enable one or more of
        the three interrupts.  An interrupt is enabled by writing a
        '1' to the appropriate position of the NVIC_ISER register.
        Unless an interrupt is enabled, the NVIC will leave a posted
        interrupt in the <em>pending</em> state.  It will remain in
        that state until the interrupt is enabled.  Once an interrupt
        for a pending interrupt is enabled, the ISR is immediately
        invoked, however it remains in the
        <em>pending</em> state until whatever generated it
        is <em>acknowledged</em>.  Note that there is a difference
        between the <em>pending bit</em> in the EXTI_PR register
        and an interrupt being in a <em>pending state</em> in the
        NVIC.  That distinction is, perhaps, too complex to study
        in this lab experiment, but the programming manual offers
        further clarification.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With this overview complete, you are ready to write the
      subroutines to make EXTI interrupts work.  Implementation
      and experimentation will make these concepts easier to
      understand.  Let's take it step by step:
    </p>

    <h3 id="PB0">2.3.1 An ISR for PB0</h3>
    <p>
      Write the EXTI interrupt handler that will be invoked for either
      PB0 or PB1.  You should look up the exact name for it in the
      startup/startup_stm32.s file.  Be sure to declare its entry
      label to be global and designate it to be a Thumb function.
      You will use this ISR to handle interrupts generated by PB0.
      It should do two things:
      </p><ul>
        <li>It should <em>acknowledge</em> the interrupt by writing
          the value EXTI_PR_PR0 to the EXTI_PR (pending register).
          The EXTI_PR_PR0 value is a symbol defined for you in the
          main.s template.  By EXTI_PR, we mean the PR offset from the
          EXTI configuration register base address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call the <b><code>togglexn</code></b> subroutine
          with the arguments that will toggle PB8, which is connected to
          an LED from last lab's wiring.  <b>Think carefully:</b> Since
          the ISR is calling another subroutine, it is not a "leaf
          subroutine", so it should use PUSH and POP to ensure that
          the LR is saved correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Look at the documentation for the EXTI_PR in section 12.3.6 of
      the STM32F0 Family Reference Manual.  Note that the offset of
      the PR register from the EXTI base address is 0x14.  This is how
      the .equ at the top of the main.s template file was determined.
      Also note that each of the bits for the EXTI_PR is listed with
      the behavior "rc_w1".  If you look at section 1.1 "List of
      abbreviations for registers" on page 41 of the Family Reference
      Manual, you will see that "rc_w1" means that software
      can <u>R</u>ead as well as <u>C</u>lear these bits by writing a
      '1'.  Writing a '0' has no effect.  The larger meaning of this
      designation is that, if you want to clear a single bit when
      others may be set, you <b> must not</b> do a load-ORRS-store
      operation since that would clear bits set in the EXTI_PR that
      you had no intention of acknowledging.  Instead, if you want to
      clear only bit 7 (1&lt;&lt;7 = 0x80), but leave the 6 bit still set to
      '1', you need only write the value 0x80 to the EXTI_PR register.
      Only the '1' bits in the value you write will have an effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      As is often the case, it take a lot of reading to understand how
      this works, but the resulting subroutine is fairly simple.  Do
      the reading, learn how it works.  Prepare for the lab practicals.
    </p>

    <h3 id="PB2">2.3.2 An ISR for PB2 and PB3</h3>
    <p>
      Write the EXTI interrupt handler that will be invoked for either
      PB2 or PB3.  You should look up the exact name for it in the
      startup/startup_stm32.s file.  Be sure to declare its entry
      label to be global and designate it to be a Thumb function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ISR should look just like the one you created for PB0,
      except that it has a different name.  You will use this ISR to
      handle interrupts generated by PB2, so it should clear bit 2 of
      the EXTI_PR register.  It should
      invoke <b><code>togglexn</code></b> to toggle pin PB9.
    </p>

    <h3 id="PB4">2.3.3 An ISR for PB4</h3>
    <p>
      Write the EXTI interrupt handler that will be invoked for PB4
      through PB15. You should look up the exact name for it in the
      startup/startup_stm32.s file. Be sure to declare its entry
      label to be global and designate it to be a Thumb function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ISR should look just like the one you created for PB0,
      except that it has a different name.  You will use this ISR to
      handle interrupts generated by PB4, so it should clear bit 4 of
      the EXTI_PR register.  It should
      invoke <b><code>togglexn</code></b> to toggle pin PB10.
    </p>

    <h3 id="init_exti">2.4 init_exti</h3>
    <p>
      Complete the subroutine <b><code>init_exti</code></b>. This will
      require multiple steps with configuration registers in different
      subsystems, but we'll walk you through them step by step.
    </p>

    <h4 id="enable_syscfg">2.4.1 Enable the SYSCFG subsystem</h4>
    <p>
      First, the subroutine should set the EXTI Configuration
      Registers (EXTICR1 and EXTICR2) that affect pins 0, 2, 3, and 4
      (we will use PB3 later...).  Note that these registers are
      mysteriously part of the SYSCFG subsystem.  Like most systems
      the STM32, an RCC clock must be enabled in order to make the
      subsystem usable.  In this case, it is the SYSCFGCOMPEN bit of
      the RCC_APB2ENR register.  There are already .equ symbols
      defined for you in the main.s template for SYSCFGCOMPEN and
      APB2ENR.  Think of the APB2ENR register as just like the AHBENR
      but meant for controlling clocks for a different set of
      peripherals.  You must read it at an offset from the RCC base
      address, OR something into the value read, and then write the
      modified value back to the APB2ENR in order to turn on an RCC
      clock to one of the subsystems it controls.
    </p>

    <div class="attention">
      <p>
        <img src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 4_files/question-mark.png" style="float: left; width: 6em; margin-right: 1em">
        The bit to enable the SYSCFG subsystem also enables a
        completely unrelated comparator (see the Family Reference
        Manual, chapter 15).  This is why the bit is named
        SYSCFGCOMPEN.  We have <u>no idea</u> why this single bit
        enables the clock for two completely disparate subsystems, or
        why its use is so obscure.  You should look at the
        documentation for the RCC's APB2ENR (Advanced Peripheral Bus
        ENable Register) if you want to form your own theory.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="config_exticr">2.4.2 Configure the port-to-pin assignment</h3>
    <p>
      Once the SYSCFG subsystem is enabled,
      <b><code>init_exti</code></b> should configure the EXTICR1 and
      EXTICR2 registers to associate pins 0, 2, 3, and 4 with Port B.
      (See the documentation for these registers in sections 10.1.2
      and 10.1.3 of the Family Reference Manual.)  EXTICR1 is a 16-bit
      register that contains four 4-bit fields.  The least significant
      4-bit field controls the port association for pin 0.  The next
      most significant 4-bit field controls the port association for
      pin 1, and so on.  Setting the 4-bit field to 0000 associates
      the pin to port A, 0001 selects port B, 0010 selects port C, and
      so on.  Set the fields of SYSCFG_EXTICR1 and SYSCFG_EXTICR2 so
      that the EXTI0, EXTI2, EXTI3, and EXTI4 fields are all set to port B
      (binary value 0001).  This will associate each
      one of these pins to port B.
    </p>

    <h3 id="init_rtsr">2.4.3 Initialize the RTSR</h3>
    <p>
      Next, add to <b><code>init_exti</code></b> so that it
      sets bits 0, 2, 3, and 4 of the EXTI_RTSR register and leaves
      the other bits unchanged.  This will configure pins 0, 2, 3, and
      4 to produce an EXTI event on the rising edge of each one of
      these pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The .equ symbols EXTI_RTSR_TR0, EXTI_RTSR_TR2, and EXTI_RTSR_TR4
      are already defined for you.  You should use them to specify the
      value that gets ORed to the value already in the EXTI_RTSR
      configuration register.
    </p>

    <h3 id="init_imr">2.4.4 Initialize the IMR</h3>
    <p>
      Continue to edit <b><code>init_exti</code></b> so that it
      sets bits 0, 2, 3, and 4 of the EXTI_IMR register and leaves the
      other bits unchanged.  Doing so will <em>unmask</em> the
      interrupt generation in the EXTI subsystem so that a transition
      will be sent to the NVIC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The .equ symbols EXTI_IMR_MR2, EXTI_IMR_MR3, and EXTI_IMR_MR4
      are already defined for you.  You should use them to specify the
      value that gets ORed to the value already in the EXTI_IMR
      configuration register.
    </p>

    <h3 id="init_iser">2.4.5 Initialize the ISER</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, <b><code>init_exti</code></b> should write the
      interrupt numbers into the NVIC ISER register.  Several
      <em>interrupt numbers</em> are already defined for you in the
      main.s template file.  For instance, if you wanted to enable the
      interrupt for EXTI ISR for pins 0 and 1, you might load the
      value
      </p><pre>        ldr  r2,=1&lt;&lt;EXTI0_1_IRQn
        ldr  r0,=NVIC
        ldr  r1,=ISER
        str  r2,[r0,r1]
      </pre>
      Note that it is not possible to do the store as you typically
      would for most configuration registers, like
      <pre>        str r2,[r1,#ISER]    // This does not work.
      </pre>
      because the ISER offset from the NVIC base address is 0x100,
      which is too large to fit in a store offset (which has a
      hexadecimal maximum of 0x7c).
    <p></p>

    <p>
      The <b><code>init_exti</code></b> subroutine should also enable
      the interrupt that is raised for an event on pins 2 or 3 as well
      the interrupt for an event on pins 4 - 15.
    </p>

    <h3 id="try_exti">2.4.6 Try it</h3>
    <p>
      At this point the <b><code>init_exti</code></b> subroutine is
      complete.  You should try it.  Press the external buttons
      connected to PB0 and PB4.  Ensure that they cause the LEDs on
      PB8 and PB10 to toggle each time they are pressed.  Button
      SW3 on the development board is connected to PB2.  Make sure that it
      toggles PB9.  This button is not <em>debounced</em>, so it may not
      be reliable (and that's not anyone's fault), but it should still be
      useful to demonstrate interrupts on PB2.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once everything works reliably, use autotest to confirm that
      everything is configured exactly as it should be.
    </p>

    <h3 id="SysTick">2.5 Implement a SysTick handler</h3>
    <p>
      The SysTick subsystem is a "core peripheral" of the
      microcontroller that cannot be disabled, so there is no RCC
      clock to enable to make it work.  It consists of a 24-bit
      down-counter that automatically reloads a new 24-bit value each
      time it reaches zero.  See the illustration in Figure 1 for the
      organization of the counter and its control registers.  Since
      they are limited to 24-bit values, the maximum value of the
      counter and reload value are 2<sup>24</sup>-1 = 16,777,215.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="lab_img" src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 4_files/systick.png">
      <b><figcaption>Figure 1: SysTick subsystem</figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>
      All that is needed to enable the SysTick counter is to set the
      ENABLE bit in the SysTick Control and Status Register (STK_CSR).
      Thereafter, the counter decrements once per clock tick.  The
      clock used for the counter is selectable by the CLKSOURCE bit of
      the CSR.  When the CLKSOURCE bit is set to 1, the counter runs
      at 48 MHz.  When CLKSOURCE is set to 0, a divide-by-8 prescaler
      is used to create a 6 MHz clock for the counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value of the down-counter can be read (or set) at any time
      by accessing the SysTick Current Value Register (STK_CVR).  When
      the value decrements to zero, the next clock tick will cause a
      new value to be loaded into the counter from the SysTick Reload
      Value Register (STK_RVR).
    </p>

    <p>
      After decrementing to zero, the counter takes one extra clock
      cycle to reload the new value.  The effective frequency of
      roll-over is then ClockRate / (RVR + 1).  For instance, if the
      48 MHz clock was selected, and the STK_RVR register was set with
      the value 11,999,999 then the counter would reach zero exactly
      four times per second.  We won't use the SysTick subsystem for
      anything else in this course, but you should get used to writing
      a value that is one less than the effective value you want into
      a configuration register.  You will see this again and again
      with other peripherals.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the TICKINT bit of the STK_CSR is set, a decrement-to-zero
      event causes the SysTick interrupt request line to the NVIC
      (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) to be asserted briefly.
      This will cause the CPU to immediately invoke the
      SysTick_Handler interrupt service routine (ISR).  This interrupt
      is one of the highest priority exceptions (for our purposes, it
      is second only to the Hardfault exception), it cannot be disabled,
      it does not need to be enabled, and it does not need to be
      <em>acknowledged</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, all you need to do to have a periodic interrupt is
      create an ISR with the proper name (SysTick_Handler), and initialize
      the CVR, RVR, and CSR registers.  Thereafter, the ISR will be
      invoked repeatedly until the SysTick CSR ENABLE or TICKINT bits
      are cleared.
    </p>

    <h3 id="SysTick_Handler">2.5.1 SysTick_Handler</h3>
    <p>
      Implement the <b><code>SysTick_Handler</code></b> interrupt service
      routine, whose basic skeleton has already been written for you in the
      main.s template.  Notice three things:
      </p><ul>
        <li>The subroutine is declared to be <em>global</em> so that
          the label is visible by other modules (in particular, the
          startup/startup_stm32.s module).
        </li>
        <li>
          The subroutine is declared to be a <em>function</em>.  This
          properly configures the address for the label so that the
          least significant bit is set, so it represents Thumb code
          rather than ARM code.  When the address of the ISR is read
          from the vector table, the CPU will examine the least
          significant bit of the address to determine if it should
          execute ARM instructions or Thumb instructions.  Since your
          microcontroller does not support ARM instructions, it is
          important that the least significant bit be set.
        </li>
        <li>
          The subroutine is properly
          spelled: <b><code>SysTick_Handler</code></b>.  Because the
          label is a <em>global</em> symbol, it will take the place of
          the <em>weak</em> symbol in the startup/startup_stm32.s module.
          The address of the ISR you write will be placed into the
          exception vector table instead of the DefaultHandler.
        </li>
      </ul>

      In the previous lab, we had the microcontroller changing the
      energized column, polling the rows, and deciding which LED to
      light in the main loop. This is a waste of resources, taking up
      the micro's time when it could be doing more useful work (like
      calculating the gcd of two large numbers) or just sleeping and
      saving power. We will now move that logic to the SysTick ISR
      with a few changes. First, since the subroutine is called every
      so often and then exits, there is no local variable for the
      current column we are energizing, so we will make this a global
      variable. Second, instead of turning on the LED when a press is
      detected, we will use the <b><code>togglexn</code></b>
      subroutine. A sample C implementation is given below which will
      need to be implemented in assembly. The constraint in the
      previous lab still holds where the row-column pairs are <br>=
      {(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)| r<sub>i</sub> ≠
      r<sub>j</sub> for i ≠ j; c<sub>i</sub> ≠ c<sub>j</sub> for
      i ≠ j; i,j=1...4}<br>
      Or no two pairs can use the same row or column.
      <pre>        void set_col(int col)
        {
            GPIOC-&gt;BSRR = (0xf &lt;&lt; (4 + 16));
            GPIOC-&gt;BSRR = (1 &lt;&lt; (8-col));
        }

        volatile int current_col = 1;

        void SysTick_Handler(void)
        {
            int row_val = GPIOC-&gt;IDR &amp; 0xf;
            if (current_col == 1 &amp;&amp; (row_val &amp; 0x8) != 0)
                togglexn(GPIOB, 8);
            else if (current_col == 2 &amp;&amp; (row_val &amp; 0x4) != 0)
                togglexn(GPIOB, 9);
            else if (current_col == 3 &amp;&amp; (row_val &amp; 0x2) != 0)
                togglexn(GPIOB, 10);
            else if (current_col == 4 &amp;&amp; (row_val &amp; 0x1) != 0)
                togglexn(GPIOB, 11);

            current_col += 1;
            if (current_col &gt; 4)
                current_col = 1;
            set_col(current_col);
        }
      </pre>
    The set_col subroutine sets energizes the column given as a
    parameter and sets the rest to zero.  We show how to use the BSRR
    register to do so.  If you prefer, you may use ORRS/BICS with the
    ODR instead.
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Recall that we used a delay in the loop for scanning the keypad
      to let the "RC network" of the matrix to settle before reading
      the value from the keypad to find what button was pressed.  In
      this case we do not.  Instead, we use a technique that will be
      used in subsequent labs.  On entry to the ISR, we read the
      GPIOC_IDR to read the rows.  At the end of the ISR, we update
      the electrical signals driven to the columns.  This means that
      an entire SysTick period elapses between writing the columns and
      reading the rows.  All we need to do is ensure we do not invoke
      the SysTick ISR so rapidly that the signals do not have enough
      time to settle between invocations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, because <b><code>SysTick_Handler</code></b> is just
      another subroutine, and since it is calling another subroutine,
      that means it is not a <em>leaf</em> subroutine.  You must save
      the LR register before calling <b><code>togglexn</code></b>.
      The easiest way to do this is to use <b><code>PUSH
      {LR}</code></b> at the entry to and <b><code>POP {PC}</code></b>
      at the exit from <b><code>SysTick_Handler</code></b>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="init_systick">2.5.2 Enabling the SysTick interrupt</h3>
    <p>
      Once the simple ISR for the SysTick interrupt is written, you
      can try using it.  To do so, complete
      the <b><code>init_systick</code></b> subroutine.  It should
      do the following things:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
	  We want STK_RVR set to a value that will cause the counter
	  to reach zero in a small time so that the columns will be
	  scanned rapidly.  Each invocation of the SysTick_Handler ISR
          will scan one of the four rows.  Set a RVR value so that all
          four rows are scanned four times per second.  (i.e., a new
          row is scanned once every sixteenth of a second.)  What value
          should you compute to do this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a value to the STK_CSR register that turns on the
          TICKINT and ENABLE bits.  For the CLKSOURCE, choose the 6
          MHz clock derived from the ÷8 prescaled clock.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      The test code in <b><code>main</code></b> is already configured
      to invoke <b><code>init_systick</code></b>.  When you run the
      program you've implemented so far, you should see the LEDs on
      PC6 (LD6) and PC7 (LD5) blink rapidly as it scans the columns.
      Once your code is working, use <b><code>autotest</code></b> to
      verify it is all correctly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Observations">3 Observations and Adjustments</h2>
    <p>
      Compile and run your completed program.  The combined effect of
      all of the subroutines you have written will be that the red
      (LD6) and yellow (LD5)  LEDs flash independently as the SysTick
      interrupt scans the columns, the debounced buttons attacheded to
      pin PB0 and PB4 invokes ISRs that toggle the green LED on PB8
      and PB10 respectively. Each of the four keypad buttons you have
      selected should also toggle one of the LEDs on PB8-PB11 (If you
      hold them down, the LED will blink. We might do edge detection
      on the keypad buttons in a later lab). The blue LED (LD3) should
      also illuminate at a rate of 1 Hz as the nano_wait is invoked with
      half a billion each time and calculated repeatedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be difficult to build a single sequential program that
      could blink LEDs in this manner.  Interrupt handling allows us
      to create the illusion that multiple things are happening
      <em>simultaneously</em> in the microcontroller.  In reality,
      only one piece of code is executing at any time.  Nevertheless,
      if the microcontroller can rapidly switch back and forth between
      different pieces of code, it can preserve the illusion.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Unacknowledged">3.1 Unacknowledged interrupts</h3>
    <p>
      Recall that you enabled the entire EXTI infrastructure for pins
      PB2 and PB3, but the ISR that is invoked for it only
      acknowledges an event on pin 2 by writing bit 2 to the pending
      register. Note what happens when you move the button on PB4 to
      PB3 an press it. When you do so, the LED on PB9 should turn on,
      and stay on regardless of how many times you press SW3 or the
      debounced push button attached to PB3.  Also notice that the
      blue LED (LD3) no longer blinks, but the yellow (LD5) and red
      (LD6) ones continue blinking at their previous rate and the
      keypad still works.  Finally, the LED on PB8 does not toggle if
      you press the button connected to PB4 (you will have to move it
      back from PB3).
    </p>

    <p>
      What is happening here?
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that the blue LED was toggled by the
      <b><code>main</code></b> subroutine in between calls to a
      long-running calculation.  When an interrupt service routine
      does not <em>acknowledge</em> the mechanism that raised the
      interrupt, the ISR is immediately reinvoked the moment it exits.
      That is to say, PB2 sets bit 2 of the EXTI_PR, which leads to
      the invocation of an ISR.  That ISR clears only bit 2 of the
      EXTI_PR.  As soon as the ISR returns, the NVIC sees that the
      cause of the interrupt still exists, so it immediately reinvokes
      the ISR to service the interrupt.  The continual reinvocation
      toggles the LED on PB9 as fast as it can.  Other higher-priority
      interrupts can still <em>preempt</em> an ISR that is running.
      This is the case with the SysTick interrupt.  Because SysTick
      has a higher priority than any of the EXTI interrupts, it can
      still be invoked at its normal time, and operate the keypad.
      The EXTI pin 2-3 ISR never returns back to the main program, so
      the blue LED no longer toggles.  The EXTI pin 4-15 ISR has a
      lower priority, and it cannot preempt the continually-running
      EXTI pin 2-3 ISR.  Pressing the button connected to PB4 causes
      that interrupt to remain in the pending state forever.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Adjusting">3.2 OPTIONAL: Adjusting interrupt priority</h3>
    <p>
      It is possible to change the <em>priority</em> of any typical
      interrupt by adjusting an entry in the NVIC_IPR (interrupt
      priority register) table.  This is an array of 32 32-bit words
      in the NVIC that control the relative importance of running ISRs
      compared to pending interrupts.  Each 32-bit word contains four
      8-bit fields to represent the priority level of four interrupts.
      Interrupt numbers 0 - 3 are handled by the first word in the
      table at offset IPR from NVIC.  Each 8-bit field can hold only
      the following four values: 0, 64, 128, or 192.  This is to say
      that only the top two most significant bits of the field are
      meaningful, so there are really only four priority levels.  The
      lower the value, the higher the priority of the interrupt type.
      (This may seem counterintuitive. but consider that something
      that is priority #1 for you is more important than priority #2.)
      Finally, the designers of the NVIC did not want to make it too
      easy for you to change priorities, so they designated that the
      IPR table values can only be read or written in 32-bit chunks.
      You cannot change the priority of an interrupt by writing a
      single 8-bit byte into the table at the proper location.  You
      must read the 32-bit word that contains the 8-bit field, clear
      the 8-bit field, then OR it with the new value, and write the
      entire word back to the IPR.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, every interrupt has a zero priority in the IPR.
      Relative priorities are further ranked by a type priority.  If
      you examine Table 37 of the Family Reference Manual which begins
      on page 217.  The "Position" column of the table shows the
      interrupt number.  This is the bit position of the interrupt in
      the NVIC_ISER, NVIC_ICER, NVIC_ISPR, and NVIC_ICPR registers.
      The interrupt number is also the <em>byte</em> offset of the
      interrupt in the NVIC_IPR table.  The second column, labeled
      "Priority" indicates the relative priority of the type of each
      interrupt if there is no difference in the NVIC_IPR table.  By
      default, the EXTI interrupt for pins 2-3 has a lower priority
      value — and, therefore, a higher importance — than
      the EXTI interrupt for pins 4-15.
    </p>

    <p>
      Non-maskable interrupts such as SysTick appear at the top of
      Table 37 in the gray zone.  They have no position number because
      there is no entry for them in registers like NVIC_ISER or
      NVIC_IPR.  Note that the "Type of priority" lists them as
      "settable", but the mechanism to do so does not involve the
      NVIC_IPR table.  Take a look at section 4.3.6 of the programming
      manual to learn about the System Handler Priority Registers
      (SHPRx) only if you are interested in learning how to use them.
    </p>

    <h3 id="adjust_priorities">3.2.1 OPTIONAL: The adjust_priorities subroutine</h3>
    <p>
      Complete the <b><code>adjust_priorities</code></b> subroutine
      for which there is already a skeleton in main.s.  It should
      do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Set the IPR priority of the EXTI interrupt for pins 2-3 to
        192 (0xc0).
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the IPR priority of the EXTI interrupt for pins 4-15 to
        128 (0x80).
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not change the priorities of any other interrupts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Upon implementing this, the EXTI interrupt for pins 2-3 will
      have the lowest priority of anything on the microcontroller, and
      the EXTI interrupt for pins 4-15 will have the second lowest
      priority.  The <b><code>adjust_priorities</code></b> subroutine
      is already invoked by the <b><code>main</code></b> subroutine.
      Now, when you run the program and press the SW3 button to assert
      PB2, the ISR for EXTI pins 2-3 will be invoked, the ISR will not
      acknowledge the interrupt, and the ISR will be immediately
      reinvoked upon exit.  Now, however, pressing the push button
      connected to PB4 will invoke a higher-priority interrupt.  The
      ISR for pins 4-15 will be invoked.  If you set a breakpoint for
      this higher-priority ISR in the debugger, press SW3 to invoke
      the non-stop lower-priority ISR, and then press the button
      connected to PB4 to invoke the higher-priority ISR, you can
      trace through the execution in the debugger.  When the
      higher-priority ISR returns, it will (most likely) return to the
      lower-priority ISR.  This is also easy to see on the Debugger
      stack trace in the upper left window.  Upon entry to the
      higher-priority ISR, the stack trace should look like:</p><pre>        Thread #1 (Suspended : Breakpoint)
        EXTI pins 4-15 ISR
        &lt;signal handler called&gt;() at 0xfffffff1
        toggle_portc_pin() at ...
        EXTI pins 2-3 ISR
        &lt;signal handler called&gt;() at 0xfffffff9
        gcd() at ...
        endless_loop() at ...
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="Repairing">3.3 OPTIONAL: Repairing the acknowledgement problem</h3>
    <p>
      You might repair the acknowledgement problem by writing a '1' to
      bit 3 of the EXTI_PR register.  (You can experiment with this on
      your own.  The autotest module will not look for it.)  Set a
      breakpoint in the ISR for pins 2 and 3.  Press the buttons for
      PB2 and PB3 and observe the behavior of the EXTI_PR register by
      looking at it in the I/O Register browser in the information
      panel of SystemWorkbench.  You can press one of the buttons to
      invoke the ISR, look at the EXTI_PR register, press the other
      button, then double-click on the EXTI_PR register to update its
      value.  Notice that it now shows the other pin is pending.  By
      reading the EXTI_PR register an ISR that manages multiple pins
      (like the one that is invoked for any of pins 4 - 15) can
      determine which of the pins mapped to it have activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you repair the ISR to acknowledge an interrupt generated by
      pin 2 as well as pin 3, try running the program again.  Notice
      that when you press the external buttons connected to PB3 and
      PB4, you toggle the PC9 and PC10 LEDs exactly once.  When you
      press the onboard SW3, you may see the LED on PB9 change or you
      may see it apparently remain in the same state.  This happens
      because SW3 <em>bounces</em>.  It is difficult to work with a
      bouncy button in the context of an interrupt service routine.
      You will get a good deal of practice handling this well in lab
      experiment 5.
