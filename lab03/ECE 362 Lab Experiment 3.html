    <h2 id="Background">Step 1: Background</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Enabling and configuring the GPIO subsystem</h3>

    <p>
      By default, every subsystem in a microcontroller is disabled in
      order to reduce power consumption, and the GPIO subsystem is no
      exception.  Each <em>port</em> must first be enabled by turning
      on a clock for the port controller.  Only after that, can the
      port be configured.  The following two steps are needed to
      configure I/O pins for use:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the Reset &amp; Clock Control (RCC) subsystem must be
      configured to enable a GPIO port for use.  This is done by turning on
      the specific bit in the AHBENR (Advanced High-Performance Bus
      Enable Register).  In doing so, be sure not to turn OFF
      important bits such as the SRAMEN bit.  Use your lecture notes
      to determine how to do this.  For this lab, in particular, you
      should enable Ports B and C by ORing the appropriate values into
      the AHBENR register.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="lab_img" src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 3_files/rcc.png">
      <b><figcaption>Figure 1: Reset and Clock Control</figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Second, an enabled port must have its pins configured as either
      inputs or outputs (or some other functions that we will use in
      future labs).  For this lab, we will initially use Port B pins
      as inputs and Port C pins as outputs.  For instance, the inputs
      used will be pins PB3 and PB4 (pins 3 and 4 of Port B).  For
      both ports there are some pins whose function you should not
      modify.  In particular, you should not change PA13, PA14, PC14,
      or PC15 since these are used for an External Oscillator,
      Debugging, and Programming interfaces.  Instead, use code from
      your lecture notes to learn how to set and clear only the bits
      you want without altering other bits.
    </p>

    <p>
      A functional diagram for an STM32F0 GPIO port is shown in Figure
      2, below:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="lab_img" src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 3_files/gpio-pin-diagram.png">
      <b><figcaption>Figure 2: GPIO Pin Functional Diagram</figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>

      In this experiment, you will enable general purpose (digital)
      inputs and outputs.  That will involve using the input data
      register (IDR) and output data register (ODR) for each port.  We
      will consider analog inputs and outputs in future lab
      experiments.

    </p>


    <h2 id="Experiment">2.0 Experiment</h2>

    <p>
      Create a project in SystemWorkbench called "lab3", and delete
      the automatically-generated main.c file.  Create a main.s file
      in the src directory.  In order to expedite setting up the
      framework for the code you will write, as well as getting all of
      the constants you will need to throughout the lab,
      a <em>template</em> file is provided for you.  You should
      download <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/lab/lab3/main.s">main.s</a> and copy
      the contents into your own lab3/src/main.s file to get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experiment uses a pre-compiled object file that contains
      test functions to automatically test the subroutines you write
      for this lab.  It is called autotest.o.  To incorporate it into
      your System Workbench project, follow the instructions in the
      <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs">ECE 362 References</a> page
      for <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs/eclipse/pre-compiled-module.html">Adding
        a pre-compiled module to a project in System Workbench</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Every subsection of this step (2.1, 2.2, ..., etc) requires a checkoff
      by your TA. Do NOT wait until the end of lab to check everything 
      off.</b>
    </p>

    <h3 id="PORTB">2.1 Configuring Port B</h3>

    <p>
      Using the main.s template file provided for this lab, fill in
      the assembly language procedure
      for <b><code>initb</code></b>.  This is should <b>enable
      the RCC clock for Port B, set pins PB8-PB11 as outputs and set
      pins PB0 &amp; PB4 as inputs</b>.
      Please refer to the notes for a refresher on how this is done. 
      This should be done without disabling other pins in RCC such as
      SRAMEN, configuring other pins as outputs, etc. Only the bits 
      needed to complete the required configuration should be changed.
      Recall <em>what a subroutine is, how it needs to be written in 
      assembly, and do not forget to push and pop the right register(s)
      </em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The global symbol "RCC" is provided for you to use as the base
      address for the Reset and Clock Control I/O registers.  Use the
      global symbol "AHBENR" as an offset into the RCC registers to
      access the AHBENR I/O register.  For instance, you can read the
      current value of the RCC_AHBENR into R1 with the code:
      </p><pre>        ldr  r0,=RCC
        ldr  r1,[r0,#AHBENR]
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Similarly, the global symbol GPIOB is provided along with the 
      symbols for MODER, IDR, ODR, BSRR, etc. Use these in a similar 
      manner to RCC and AHBENR to configure pins PB8-PB11 as output 
      pins (and to read and write their driven values in later 
      sections.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you look at the documentation in the Family Reference Manual
      regarding a GPIO port's MODER register, you will notice that all
      pins that can be used as inputs are set as inputs by default.
      We want you to get some practice clearing bits of the MODER as
      well as setting bits.  Your subroutine should also configure
      pins 0 and 4 of Port B as inputs <em>with the assumption that
      they may have already been configured as outputs</em>.  This
      means you should clear the two-bit value for each pin in
      question to <code>00</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b><code>autotest</code></b> module provided for you will
      call this and every other subroutine you write muliple times in
      different ways.  It will deliberately set and clear other bits
      in the AHBENR to make sure that you are doing a proper OR
      operation to set only the necessary bits and not setting or
      clearing any other bits.  The procedure for ORing bits into a
      configuration register may seem cumbersome, but it will occur
      repeatedly for many types of peripherals.  You'll soon get used
      to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When debugging individual subroutines you should leave the call
      to <b><code>autotest</code></b> commented out so that you can
      step through the operation of each subroutine.  You must
      complete each step of implementation in sequence.  You will not
      get credit for steps 2 through 6 without first satisfactorily
      completing step 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hint: When debugging your code, you may consult the "I/O
      Registers" tab in the Monitor window.  This tab provides a
      hierarchical listing of all of the various peripherals utilized
      by the microcontroller and their sub-registers.  By default
      their values are not shown; double clicking on a given entry
      will cause the debugger to track the values of that entry and
      its lower elements.  Use this to confirm that the various
      registers you are writing to are taking on the values which you
      expect.  An example of this is shown in Figure 3, below.  When
      you cannot understand why a GPIO port is behaving as you expect,
      take a look at the registers and make sure their contents are
      being set correctly.  This is a process that you will use for
      the rest of the semester.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="lab_img" src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 3_files/io-registers-viewer.png">
      <b><figcaption>Figure 3: I/O Registers Viewer</figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>
      You can also use the I/O Registers viewer to modify values to
      experiment with register settings.  As you progress through the
      lab experiment, you will find that you can use the I/O Registers
      viewer to deposit values into the ODR of Port C.  This will
      cause LEDs to illuminate.  You can also examine the value of the
      Port B IDR in real time to determine if a button is pressed.
      Note that the same rules apply just as if you wrote code to do
      things programmatically.  You will not be able to view or adjust
      values for any of the registers of a GPIO port before enabling
      the clock to that subsystem in the RCC AHBENR.  You can
      experiment with doing that manually as well.
    </p>

    <h3 id="PORTC">2.2 Configuring Port C</h3>
    <p>
      For this section, you will need to complete the subroutine
      <b><code>initc</code></b> in main.s so that GPIOC's clock is
      enabled in RCC and it configures only pins 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Port
      C as outputs. These pins will drive the colunms of the keypad
      (the wiring and schematic for which will be introduced later).
      Set pins 0, 1, 2, and 3 as inputs and to use the internal pull
      down resistors by setting the relevant bits in the PUPDR
      register. These will read the rows of the keypad and need to be
      pulled down to keep from reading erroneous floating signals. You
      should use the symbolic constant GPIOC as the address of Port C.
      The symbol "MODER" is the offset from the base address for the
      mode register.  For instance, you can read the current value of
      the MODER register of GPIOC into R1 by doing the following:
      </p><pre>        ldr  r0,=GPIOC
        ldr  r1,[r0,#MODER]
      </pre>
      A similar process can be used to read and set values in the
      PUPDR register. 
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Reminder: Be sure not to change the configuration for pins 13,
      14, and 15.  Once again, make sure to push and pop the right
      register(s).
    </p>


    <h3 id="Turning">2.3 Set PORTB pin outputs</h3>
    <p>
      For this section, you will need to complete the subroutines
      <b><code>setn</code></b> in main.s. The first parameter
      (register R0) is the bit number (the same as the pin number) to
      be set (by <b><code>setn</code></b>). The second parameter
      (given by R1) is the value to set the pin to (either zero or
      anything not zero).  The <b><code>setn</code></b> subroutine
      turns off the pin/bit number (R0) in the GPIOB_ODR register if
      the value in the second parameter (R1) is zero.  Otherwise, it
      turns on the pin/bit number (R0).  For instance, if you
      execute <b><code>setn(8,0)</code></b>, it would turn pin 8 off.
      If you invoked it as <b><code>setn(8,59823)</code></b> it would turn
      pin 8 on.  Here, the value 59823 is arbitrary.  Any value other zero
      in the second argument should turn the pin on.
      Use the global symbol "ODR" as the offset from a GPIO
      port to the output data register. You are encouraged to use the
      BRR and BSRR registers to implement these subroutines.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Reading">2.4 Read PORTB pin inputs</h3>
    <p>
      Complete the subroutine <b><code>readpin</code></b> in main.s.
      This function accepts a bit number as parameter 1 (register R0).
      It returns the value (in register R0) in GPIOB_IDR at the bit
      specified by parameter 1 (register R0).  In other words, the
      subroutine should return 0x1 if the pin is high or 0x0 if the
      pin is low.
    </p>

        <b>Unplug the programmer the USB port to remove power from
            the development board before you wire components.</b>
        Anytime you plug things in to the microcontroller when the power
        is on, you run the risk of connecting something you shouldn't have
        and causing damage.  By removing power, you have the opportunity
        to double-check your work before you reconnect power.  You can ask
        one of your TAs to triple-check your work.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      After you remove the power from your development board, wire
      your circuit as shown in Figure 4, below.  Ensure that you are
      connecting resistors for the buttons to the 3V power.  You are
      advised to connect the power buses on your breadboard array to
      the GND and 3V connections on the development board.  (Leave the
      5V pins unconnected to avoid using them.)

    <p>
      Use your choice of red, yellow, and green LEDs to build the
      circuit in Figure 4.  To determine the orientation of an LED,
      look at the length of the leads.  The long lead of the LED is
      usually the <em>anode</em> (the positive terminal) and the short
      lead is the <em>cathode</em> (the side connected to ground in
      the schematic).  You can also search for a flattened section of
      the circular rim of the LED.  That also indicates the cathode.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use four-lead "tactile" push buttons for the switches.  The
      6x6mm push buttons work the same way as the 12x12mm push
      buttons.  Note that pins 1 and 2 are connected together
      internally as well are pins 3 and 4.  The push button is
      "normally open".  When it is pressed, pins 1 and 2 are connected
      to pins 3 and 4.  See the diagrams in Figure 5 for more details.

      You will use a 16-button keypad for this lab experiment. One
      configuration for such an arrangement of buttons would be to
      have two wires for each button (32 wires total) so that each
      button could be independently monitored. That would require a
      lot of pins on the keypad which might make it difficult to use
      on a breadboard. An optimization might be to have one common
      power connector and one more connector per button (17 wires
      total) so that each button could still be monitored
      individually. But this is still too many pins on the keypad than
      manufacturers will usually support, and the numbers would only
      be much worse for keypads with even more buttons.

      <b><figcaption>Figure 6: Keypad internal schematic</figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The typical concession for keypads is to have multiple common
      pins that connect to groups of buttons. The logical extension to
      this trend is to configure a keypad as a matrix of rows and
      columns. If the number of rows and columns is about equal, this
      practice minimizes the number of pins on the keypad. The added
      challenge is that the keypad must be scanned one row or column
      at a time. For instance, a voltage can be applied to a row of
      buttons, and the columns can be sensed to detect if any of the
      buttons in the row are being pressed. Then the voltage can be
      removed from the row and re-applied to another row. By cycling
      through all the rows, all keys can eventually be detected.

    <p>
      When you are finished, your circuitry should look something like
      Figure 7, below.  You can, of course, arrange your circuitry in
      any manner you want, but we will be using the keypad in this
      configuration for the rest of the semester,  It might be good
      if you keep it as close to this picture as possible.  In particular,
      look at those blue resistors whose leads have been cut short to let
      them sit flush in on the breadboard.  You are strongly encouraged
      to do the same.  Later in the semester, we'll put the resistors under
      the keypad, and there is no good way to do that without making the
      leads short.  Cut each lead so that only 8mm - 10mm extends from each
      side.  Bend the leads at an angle, and push the resistor down into the
      breadboard.  (Resistors are inexpensive.  Don't feel bad about snipping
      them.)

    <h3 id="Buttons">2.6 Buttons and LEDs</h3>
    <p>
      Complete the subroutine <b><code>buttons</code></b> in main.s.
      This function will be called repeatedly in a loop. The purpose
      of this function is to map the button presses (inputs on PB0 and
      PB4) to two of the 4 LEDs (on PB8-PB11). So if a button is
      pressed an LED should turn on and once it is released the LED
      should turn off. Same goes for the other button and a different
      LED. A sample implementation in C is given below, but yours
      doesn't have to be implemented like this. 
      </p><pre>        void buttons(void)
	{
          setn(8, readpin(0));
          setn(9, readpin(4));
        }
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="Keypad">2.7 Keypad and LEDs</h3>
    <p>
      Complete the subroutine <b><code>keypad</code></b>. It will be
      called in an infinte loop. The subroutine should iterate through
      all the column pins (PC4-PC7), setting one high and the rest low
      on each iteration. In each iteration, it should check all the
      row input values (PC0-PC3). For each column, if a button in a
      certain row is pressed, a light should turn on, and when it is
      released, it should turn off. No two columns can use buttons on
      the same row and no two columns can use the same LED. A sample
      implementation in C is given below, but your implementation
      doesn't have to match ours.
      </p><pre>      void keypad(void)
      {
        for(int c=8; c&gt;0; c = c&gt;&gt;1) {
          GPIOC-&gt;ODR = c &lt;&lt; 4;
          mysleep();
          int r = GPIOC-&gt;IDR &amp; 0xf;
          if (c == 8) {
            setn(8, r &amp; 1);
          } else if (c == 4) {
            setn(9, r &amp; 2);
          } else if (c == 2) {
            setn(10, r &amp; 4);
          } else {
            setn(11, r &amp; 8);
          }
        }
      }
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Notice the function <b><code>mysleep</code></b> in the body of
      the function above. This is needed because if you were to press
      both the 7 and * key (for example), the light wouldn't turn on,
      even though with the code above, it should. This is because the
      microcontroller sets and checks the pins too quickly, not giving
      the driving column enough time to charge the row lines (think of
      an RC circuit)! With the call to <b><code>mysleep</code></b>
      inserted in between the set and check, this issue is
      averted. <b><code>mysleep</code></b> can be implemented simply
      as an empty spinning for loop.
      </p><pre>        void mysleep(void)
        {
          for(int n=0; n&lt;1000; n++)
            ;
        }
      </pre>
      In other words, write a subroutine that sets a register, and increments it
      and checks it in a loop.  The point is to just waste some time.
