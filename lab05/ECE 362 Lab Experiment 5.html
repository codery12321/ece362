      Each timer subsystem allows the microcontroller to produce
      periodic interrupts while the CPU is busy with other operations.
      In this experiment, we will use timer interrupts to periodically
      scan a matrix keypad and reliably report button presses.

    <h2 id="Background">Step 1: Background and wiring</h2>

    <h3 id="Debouncing">1.1 Debouncing buttons</h3>

    <p>
      Because switches are mechanical devices, they bounce.  This
      means we do not get a stable electrical signal on a press or a
      release.  Because of switch bounce, the voltage fluctuates
      between V<sub>DD</sub> and ground before settling down to a
      stable value.  There are several ways to fix this.  Debouncing
      can be performed in hardware or software.
    </p>

    <p>
      We used to make debouncing a central part of this lab
      experiment, however doing so in assembly language was a
      difficult exercise.  We'll do a better job in lab experiment 6.
      The following information is presented for your consideration
      on lab 6.  For <b>this lab</b>, we won't debounce the button
      presses.  Instead, we'll build an application that is tolerant
      of redundant detection of the same button.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>1) Hardware debouncing:</b> You have already seen this
      working well in previous labs (lab 3).  Hardware debouncing is
      done via a simple RC network to filter high frequency glitches
      that occur from mechanical bounce.  The Schmitt trigger inputs
      of the microcontroller can tolerate the relatively low speed of
      the signal changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2) Software debouncing:</b> In certain applications it might
      be beneficial to debounce switches in software rather than use
      an RC filter on each switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Software debouncing can be achieved in a variety of methods.
      The simplest debouncing method is to read the voltage, wait for
      the switch to settle and read it again.  However there are more
      robust approaches, which are more suited for a keypad matrix.
      Here we describe one such method that we call the "history
      method".
    </p>

    <p>
      In this "history" method we store N previous button states.
      Each button's history is represented by a single variable.  This
      variable is referred from here on, as the 'history variable'.
      The least significant bit of the history variable represents the
      most recent button state and the most significant bit represents
      the oldest button state in history.  When a new button state is
      read, the history variable is shifted left by one, making space
      for the new state in the least significant bit.  The new state
      value (i.e.  0 or 1) is ORed into the history variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we have a history of button states we can look for two
      specific patterns to identify a button press and release.  An
      8-bit pattern of <b><code>00000001</code></b> represents the
      first moment of a button press and <b><code>11111110</code></b>
      represents the first moment that of a button release.  Note that
      these patterns are applicable when the button's logic is active
      high, else the patterns are switched.  Therefore, by checking if
      the history variable equals 1 (i.e. 00000001) we can detect a
      button press.  Similarly by checking if history variable is 0xfe
      (i.e. 11111110) we can detect a button release.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Reading">1.2 Reading a button matrix</h3>
    <p>
      A matrix of buttons presents an additional complication to the
      challenge of debouncing since it is not possible to monitor each
      button separately.  To understand why this is so, it's helpful
      to discuss how a matrix keypad works.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will use a 16-button keypad for this lab experiment.  One
      configuration for such an arrangement of buttons would be to
      have two wires for each button (32 wires total) so that each
      button could be independently monitored.  That would require a
      lot of pins on the keypad which might make it difficult to use
      on a breadboard.  An optimization might be to have
      one <em>common</em> power connector and one more connector per
      button (17 wires total) so that each button could still be
      monitored individually.  But this is still too many pins on the
      keypad than manufacturers will usually support, and the numbers
      would only be much worse for keypads with even more buttons.
    </p>

    <p>
      The typical concession for keypads is to have
      multiple <em>common</em> pins that connect to groups of buttons.
      The logical extension to this trend is to configure a keypad as
      a <em>matrix</em> of rows and columns.  If the number of rows
      and columns is about equal, this practice minimizes the number
      of pins on the keypad.  The added challenge is that the keypad
      must be scanned one row or column at a time.  For instance, a
      voltage can be applied to a column of buttons, and the rows can
      be sensed to detect if any of the buttons in the column are being
      pressed.  Then the voltage can be removed from the column and
      re-applied to another column.  By cycling through all the columns, all
      keys can eventually be detected.  The difficulty is that, not
      only do the buttons still bounce, the bouncing must be tracked
      over multiple successive scans.
    </p>

      </figcaption></b>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The schematic for the keypad matrix you will use for this lab
      experiment is shown in Figure 1.  For this experiment, you will
      implement the 'history' method of debouncing buttons.  For each
      of the 16 keys, an 8-bit variable is used.  Each history
      variable is stored as an element of a 16-byte array in RAM.  The
      array's first 4 elements, 0 – 3 represent the history for
      the first column of keys, the elements from 4 – 7 represent
      the history values of the second column of keys and so on.  Since
      buttons will be sampled four at a time, the history values will
      also be updated four at a time.  This is effectively equivalent
      to sampling a single button at a time except that the samples
      are further apart.  Button presses and releases are still
      detected the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another minor downside of this method is that it is not always
      possible to detect multiple simultaneous button presses.  For
      instance, if Col1 has an applied voltage, it is possible to
      detect the '1' and '4' buttons pressed simultaneously because
      they will be connected to distinct rows.  It is also possible to
      detect two buttons in different rows and different columns.
      Nevertheless, if two buttons in the same row are pressed
      simultaneously, the results will be unreliable.  For instance,
      if '1' and '2' are pressed, when Col1 has a high voltage
      applied, Col2 will have a low voltage applied, and vice-versa.
      The value read on the Row1 will be indefinite.  There is a way
      to overcome this difficulty: use pull-up resistors on the
      columns as well as the rows, and configure the driven pins to
      use open-drain outputs so that they can only be pulled low.
      Then, the presence of a high voltage read on the row pins always
      indicates "no button in this row pressed" and a low voltage on
      one or more row pins indicates a button press.  (Inverted
      thinking, like this, is difficult when programming in assembly
      language.  We might give this a try in the future, but not now.)

        In the event that logic high and logic low are applied in a
        way that current flows through a button, the keypad button may
        be damaged.  In this experiment, you will be driving every
        column either high or low.  If two buttons are pressed in the
        same row, that could mean be lots of current flowing from one

        this reason, you will use 1KΩ series resistors between
        the STM32 and all of the pins of the keypad.  By doing so, there
        cannot possibly be any damage.

    <h3 id="Driving">1.3 Driving multiplexed displays</h3>
    <p>
      A 7-segment display is one that has seven LED segments in the
      shape of a number "8".  By selectively turning segments on,
      other numbers can be displayed.  In practice, such displays have
      more than seven segments.  An eighth segment shows a decimal
      point.  Recall Figure 2, from ECE 270, that shows the names of
      the segments of a display.  The top segment is customarily
      called "A".  Proceeding clockwise, the next ones are named "B",
      "C", and so on.  The middle segment is named "G".  The decimal
      point is named "DP".

      For this lab experiment, you will be using the TDCR1050M 4-digit
      7-segment LED display.  This device was made to be used in a
      clock, so it has a middle colon for use in displaying a time.
      Another dot on the display can be illuminated to indicate things
      like an alarm setting.  For this experiment, we will use only
      the digits and decimal points.

    </figure>

    <p>
      If you look at a picture of the physical device in Figure 3, you
      see that it has only two rows of eight pins on each side.  Only
      sixteen pins are used to control more than 30 individual LED
      segments that must be independently lit to form four distinct
      digits and decimal points.  To do so, it uses a "common anode"
      configuration so that one pin is connected to the anodes of all
      the LEDs on one digit.  There are four distinct pins connected
      to the anodes of the four digits.  There are another eight pins
      connected to similar cathodes on all the displays.  For
      instance, one pin is connected to the four "A" cathodes on the
      four digits.  This means it is possible to illuminate all four
      of the "A" segments on the four digits by applying a positive
      voltage to the four common anodes and a negative voltage to the
      pin connected to all of the "A" segments.  It is not possible to
      simultaneously illuminate the "A" segment of all the displays
      and illuminate the "B" segment of only a single display.  Figure
      4 shows the schematic for the connections to all of the LED
      segments for the display.

    <p>
      If it is not possible to independently turn on and off
      individual segments at the same time, how is it possible to
      display distinct numerals on the four groups of segments?  This
      display is made to be <em>multiplexed</em>.  In a manner similar
      to how we cannot detect the exact moment that a button in a
      matrix is pressed, we cannot simultaneously turn on every LED
      segment we need.  Instead, the segments of the first digit are
      turned on, then the segments of the next digit are turned on,
      then the third, then the fourth.  If each individual digit is
      illuminated for one second, then the display will not be
      perceived as a four-digit number.  If, however, the cycling
      through the digits is done quickly enough, it
      will <em>appear</em> that all of the numbers are shown
      simultaneously.  This is because of the human
      eye's <em>persistence of vision</em>.  A flickering
      light—as long as the flickering is rapid enough—is
      perceived as continually on, although maybe dimmer than normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, consider the result of applying the following
      cycle of voltages applied to the pins of the display:
      </p><ul>
        <li>A positive voltage to pin 1 (D1), and a negative voltage to
          pins 16 (B) and 13 (C)</li>
        <li>A positive voltage to pin 2 (D2), and a negative voltage to
          pins 14 (A), 16 (B), 3 (D), 5 (E), and 15 (G)</li>
        <li>A positive voltage to pin 6 (D3), and a negative voltage to
          pins 14 (A), 16 (B), 13 (C), 3 (D), and 15 (G)</li>
        <li>A positive voltage to pin 8 (D4), and a negative voltage to
          pins 16 (B), 13 (C), 11 (F), and 15 (G).
      </li></ul>
      When these four configurations are applied repeatedly and at
      high speed, it will <em>appear</em> that the four-digit number
      "1234" is present on the display.
    <p></p>

    <p>
      How rapidly must you cycle through each digit to achieve the
      effect of persistence of vision?  Usually, anything flickering
      faster than 30 times per second appears to be continually on.
      As long as all of the digits of the display are turned on and
      off more than 30 times per second (even though none of them are
      on at the same time as others) the display will appear
      continuous.  In this lab experiment, you will use two groups of
      the four-digit displays (eight digits in total), and you will
      turn on each digit for one thousandth of a second.  By
      illuminating each individual digit for one-thousandth of a
      second, any one of the eight displays will be illuminated eight
      times less frequently (or 1/125th of a second). This is much
      faster than is needed to perceive the digits as all being on
      simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Sink">1.4 Use of a sink driver and high-side transistors</h3>
    <p>
      Most students, when they approach the idea of multiplexing,
      would be more comfortable with a "common cathode" display
      instead since it could be configured so that a positive voltage
      applied to the pin connected to the anodes of all "A" segments
      would illuminate that segment when a negative voltage is applied
      to the pin connected to all the cathodes of the digit.  If you
      were connecting the pins directly to your microcontroller, that
      might even make sense.  Nevertheless, the current-flow
      requirements for the LEDs make it impractical to illuminate many
      of them using only the capabilities of the microcontroller.
      Instead, it is common use <em>sink driver</em> connected to the
      cathodes of each type of segment (e.g., "A", "B", "C", etc...).
      A sink driver is a device that is capable of sinking (connecting
      to ground) a connection with a large current flow.  47Ω
      limiting resistors will be placed in between the sink driver and
      each cathode to prevent too much current from flowing through
      each segment.  Conveniently, the sink driver will sink current
      through an output pin when its corresponding input pin is high.
      In this way, it acts as an open-drain inverter.  (A sink driver
      cannot push an output pin high.)  Using the sink driver, a logic
      high applied to the driver will cause the particular segment to
      illuminate, which is how you would like to think about it.
    </p>

    <figure>

      <b><figcaption>Figure 5: Typical LED display circuit</figcaption></b>

    <p>
      Consider the circuit in Figure 5 that appears in the TLC59211
      datasheet.  In this lab experiment, you will wire the
      microcontroller to the sink driver rather than an 8-bit shift
      register.  The device at the top of the diagram is a PNP bipolar
      junction transistor (BJT).  This device will conduct current
      through the top pin (the emitter) in the direction of the arrow,
      and out the bottom pin (the collector) when the middle left pin
      (the base) has a voltage lower than the emitter (and a small
      current coming out of it).  It is conceptually similar to a
      P-Channel MOSFET except that a MOSFET does not require a
      substantial current flow through its gate.  By contrast, the
      collector current for a BJT is directly proportional to its base
      current.

    <p>
      <img src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/pn2907a.png" style="float: left; width: 10em;
      margin-right: 1em"> You will use one PN2907A PNP BJT (in a TO-92
      package) for each anode of each digit of the display.  Pay
      careful attention to the designations for the pins (E,B,C for
      emitter, base, collector) on the device.  Pin 1 is the emitter,
      pin 2—in the middle—is the base, and pin 3 is the
      collector.  The anode of a digit must be able to supply enough
      current for all eight segments of the digit simultaneously.  The
      datasheet for the TDCR1050M shows that each of the eight
      segments of each digit could use as much as 25 mA, although you
      won't have that much current flow for this experiment.  A
      microcontroller pin would not be able to supply enough current
      to illuminate all of the segments of a digit, but a PN2907
      transistor will provide at least 200mA if needed.  Because the
      transistor is driving the positive voltage to the display, it is
      referred to as the "high-side" driver for the display.  You may
      think of the sink driver as the "low-side" driver for the
      display.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than try to deal with low voltage to enable current flow
      through each PNP transistor, we will add one more device: a
      3-to-8 decoder with active-low outputs.  Three input pins select
      one of eight outputs to be driven low.  Each one of these
      outputs will be connected, through a series resistor, to the
      base of one high-side driver transistor.  Altogether, eleven
      pins of the microcontroller will be used to drive the display:
      three to select the digit to turn on through the decoder and
      high-side driver transistors, and eight more to turn on the
      segments of the selected digit.  A full schematic of the wiring
      for the display and keypad is shown in Figure 6.

      It can be difficult to follow all of the connections as they
      cross over each other.  A second schematic, with most of the
      wires replaced by symbolic connections is shown in Figure 7.
      That should offer slightly more clarity in how the connections
      are made.  A schematic is normally intended for a high-level
      understanding of the logical connections, and has few details
      about the physical layout of components.  Nevertheless, some
      nuances of the physical construction are preserved in these
      schematics.  In particular, note that the transistors are
      numbered, from left to right, Q1, Q0, Q3, Q2, and so on.  This
      is intentional since that is the way they will be placed on the
      breadboard.

    <h3 id="Tips">1.5 Tips for wiring the circuit</h3>
    <p>
      You'll be assembling two 4-digit display modules, driven by 8
      PN2970A transistors, a TLC59211 sink driver, 8 resistors between
      the sink driver and LED cathodes, a 3-to-8 decoder, and 8 more
      resistors between the decoder and the transistors.  Another eight
      resistors will be used to connect the keypad to the
      microcontroller.  With some planning, it will be possible to
      assemble this quickly and reliably.  Here are several suggestions
      to make it as easy as possible...
    </p>

    <h3 id="Transistors">1.5.1 Place the transistors next to the displays</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/transistors.png">
        <img src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/transistors.png" style="float: left; width: 10em;
      margin-right: 1em" title="How to wire the transistors"></a> The
      collector of a PN2907A transistor must be connected to each of
      pins 1, 2, 6, and 8 of both display modules.  Notice that these
      pins are all on one side of the display, and that two of them
      are near the ends of the row of pins.  There are no connections
      to the left or right of the connector, but there is a lot of
      space taken up by the displays.  Rather than run long wires from
      the transistors to the displays, put the collector of one
      transistor on pin 1 and the collector of another transistor on
      pin 8.  The other pins of each transistor are placed to the left
      and right, respectively.  Add another two transistors further
      out by combining the emitters on the same breadboard row.
      Finally, connect the collectors of the outermost transistors to
      pins 2 and 6.  Looking from left to right, the first
      backward-facing transitor will connect power to D2 (pin 2).
      The next forward-facing transistor will connect power to D1 (pin
      1).  The next transistor will connect power to D4 (pin 8), and
      the fourth transistor will connect power to D3 (pin 6).  Note
      the alternating backward-facing, forward-facing manner in which
      the transistors are placed.  The base (middle pin) of each of
      the transistors is what will be driven, through a 150Ω
      resistor, by the decoder.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Resistors">1.5.2 Wire the resistors directly to the display</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/resistors-direct.png">
        <img src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/resistors-direct.png" style="float:  left; width: 10em; margin-right: 1em" title="Resistors wired directly to cathodes and TLC59211">
      </a>
      Five of the LED cathodes are on the "top" side row of connectors
      (pins 16,15,14,13,11) of the display, and three of them are on
      the "bottom" row of connectors (pins 3,5,7).  Each of the eight
      cathodes must be connected to an output of the TLC59211 sink
      driver via a series 47 Ω resistor.  If you have bulk 22
      gauge copper wire, you can remove a suitable amount of
      insulation and put it on each of the five resistors to keep them
      from touching the pins they run near.  Run the resistor leads
      between the pins below the display.
      <a href="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/resistors-direct2.png">

      </a>
      Place the TLC59211 on
      an adjacent breadboard, in the right position to directly
      connect the resistors.  The other three resistors are easy to
      wire between pins 3,5,7 and the sink driver.
      Place the resistors between the cathodes and the TLC59211
      outputs in the most convenient way possible.  Connect the wires
      between the STM32 Port C and the TLC59211 so that PB0 lights
      segment A, PB1 lights segment B, ... , PB6 lights segment G, and
      PB7 lights segment DP.

      </a>
      If you are not able to insulate resistor leads in this way,
      leave some space on the right side of the rightmost display
      module, connect the resistors on the top side of the display
      module, and run wires from the other side of the resistors to
      the TLC59211.  It's your choice.  Either way will work well.
      Neatness of connections will avoid a great deal of problems when
      you reach the point of debugging.  A maze of wires that loop far
      over the breadboard will not only block the LED segments, it
      will be difficult to diagnose, and be prone to damage when the
      wires are snagged on objects while in transport.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Chain">1.5.3 Chain the cathodes from one display to the other</h3>
    <p>
      The eight connections to the cathodes of display on the right
      should be made to the same eight pins on the display on the
      left.  Use eight wires to connect them together.  I.e., connect
      pin 16 on the left display to pin 16 of the right display, pin
      15 to 15, etc.  The pins to connect together on the top side of
      the displays are 16, 15, 14, 13, and 11.  The pins on the bottom
      side of the displays are 3, 5, and 7.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Resistors">1.5.4 Connect resistors to the decoder</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/decoder-resistors.png">

      </a>
      The 150Ω resistors should be placed directly on the
      74HC138 decoder.  If you want to be tidy, you might cut the
      leads to minimize the amount that they stick out of the
      breadboard.  If you do so, make sure that leads of every
      resistor is wide enough to span four breadboard holes.  A width
      of only three would mean, for instance, that the resistor on the
      Y2 output would connect to the V<sub>CC</sub> pin of the chip.
      Wires should be run from the other ends of the resistors to the
      bases of the transistors.  Connect output Y0 through a
      150Ω resistor to the base of the PNP transistor connected
      to pin 1 of the left display.  Note that output Y7 is on the
      bottom side of the 74HC138 decoder on pin 7.  Pin 8 is the
      ground connection.  The decoder's select lines, A0, A1, and A2
      (pins 1,2, and 3, respectively) should be connected to PC6, PC7,
      and PC8.  Pins 4, 5, and 6 should be connected to GND, GND, and
      V<sub>CC</sub>, respectively.  These three pins are
      the <em>enable</em> pins for the decoder.  Unless all three of
      these pins are enabled, <b>none of the decoder outputs will be
      asserted</b> (driven low).

    <h3 id="Check">1.5.5 Check your wiring</h3>

      </a>
      To test your wiring, write an assembly language program that sets
      GPIOB pins 0 - 10 to be outputs.  Then write the following values
      to GPIOB_ODR in rapid succession:
      </p><pre>      0x03f, 0x106, 0x25b, 0x34f, 0x466, 0x56d, 0x67d, 0x707
      </pre>
      This will cause the 8-bit value 0x3f to be driven on digit 0 (the
      leftmost digit), 0x06 will be written to digit 1, and so on.
      Make the CPU pause between successive writes by adding a delay loop
      (perhaps use nano_wait from the last lab).  Otherwise, the updates
      to the digits will happen while the digit selection is still propagating
      through the 74HC138 chips, and the display will be blurred.
      The pattern <b><code>01234567</code></b> should appear on the
      seven-segment displays.  If you want to display the decimal point of, say,
      the last digit, change the value written from 0x707 to 0x787.
      The picture to the left shows a situation where the bases of two
      transistors are connected to the wrong decoder output resistors.
      Instead of <b><code>01234567</code></b>, the display shows
      <b><code>01<font color="red">32</font>4567</code></b>.  An
      easy mistake to make as well as to correct.

    <p>
      You might also look ahead to Section 2 of this lab document to find out how to
      set up the main.s template and obtain the autotest.o module.
      The autotest.o module for this experiment also has a wiring
      checker.  Uncomment the <b><code>bl check_wiring</code></b> call
      in main.s.  When first started, the
      digits <b><code>01234567</code></b> should appear on the
      seven-segment displays.  The decimal point on the leftmost digit
      should illuminate for 0.25 seconds, then turn off and the
      decimal point on the next digit should illuminate for 0.25
      seconds.  The decimal point should cycle through all of the
      digits in two seconds and continue again with the leftmost.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the decimal point illuminates, make sure that the other
      segments of each digit remain at the same brightness.  If the
      other segments of a digit grow dimmer, it may be that the driver
      transistor for that digit is <em>backward</em>.  A BJT
      transistor normally amplifies a small base-emitter current with
      a large collector-emitter current, but a BJT can also work backward
      so that it amplifies a small base-collector current to a larger
      emitter-collector current.  The amplification is not as high, and
      it limits the current provided to a digit.  The more segments per
      digit are lit, the dimmer they are.  Carefully note the orientation
      of the transistors connected to the D1, D2, D3, and pins of each
      display.

      Once the display is showing the correct digits and the decimal
      point is repeatedly moving from left to right, try pressing
      buttons on the keypad.  Each button will cause a corresponding
      letter to be shifted onto the display to the rightmost digit,
      and the other seven digits will shift left.  The asterisk is
      represented with a Greek Xi (Ξ), and the <b>octothorpe</b> is
      represented with an "H".  (You think I'm inventing a new word
      here?  Go look that up.)  If you press the '1' button, and a new
      'A' gets shifted in on the right, it means you've switched the
      Row1 and Row4 wires on the keypad.  If you press the '3' button,
      and a new '0' is shifted in on the right, it means that the
      wires to Row2 and Row3, as well as the wires to Col1 and Col4,
      are switched.  By pressing buttons and looking at the outcome,
      you can determine which wires are incorrect.

    <h2 id="Experiment">2.0 Experiment</h2>

    <p>
      Create a project in SystemWorkbench called "lab5", and delete
      the automatically-generated main.c file.  Create a main.s file
      in the src directory.  In order to expedite setting up the
      framework for the code you will write, as well as getting all of
      the constants you will need throughout the lab,
      a <em>template</em> file for main.s is provided for you.  You should
      download <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/lab/lab5/main.s">main.s</a> and copy
      the contents into your own lab5/src/main.s file to get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experiment uses a pre-compiled object file that contains
      test functions to automatically test the subroutines you write
      for this lab.  It is called autotest.o.  To incorporate it into
      your System Workbench project, follow the instructions in the
      <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs">ECE 362 References</a> page
      for <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/refs/eclipse/pre-compiled-module.html">Adding
      a pre-compiled module to a project in System Workbench</a>.  It
      provides an interactive serial interface in the same manner that
      you have seen in previous lab experiments.  You can use it to
      test the operations you write.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this lab experiment, the autotest.o module also contains
      a <b><code>check_wiring</code></b> subroutine to test that the
      LED displays and keypad are wired properly.  <!--It also contains
      duplicate subroutines for everything you will implement in the
      lab (except the ISRs).  For any normal subroutine, you can
      preface it with <b><code>good_</code></b> to try a pre-written
      subroutine that works correctly.  If, for instance, you are
      having difficulty with the <b><code>enable_ports</code></b>, you
      can replace the call with <b><code>good_enable_ports</code></b>.
      You won't get get a score for any work you do while you are
      using any of the good_ subroutines.  They're only a temporary
      aid for development.-->
    </p>

    <h3 id="enable_ports">2.1.1: enable_ports: Enable GPIO ports</h3>
    <p>
      Write a subroutine called <b><code>enable_ports</code></b>
      that does the following:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Enables the RCC clock to GPIOB and GPIOC without affecting
          any other RCC clock settings for other peripherals</li>
        <li>Configures pins PB0 – PB10 to be outputs</li>
        <li>Configures pins PC4 – PC8 to be outputs</li>
        <li>Configures pins PC0 – PC3
        to be inputs<br>
        </li><li>Configures pins PC0 – PC3 to be
        internally <em>pulled low</em></li>
        
      </ul>
      As usual, you should not alter the configuration for any other
      pins.  For instance, if you were to improperly alter the MODER
      setting for PC12, the serial port would stop working.
    <p></p>


    <h3 id="TIM6_ISR">2.1.2: Basic Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</h3>
    <p>
      Write an interrupt service routine (ISR) for Timer 6 (TIM6).
      Look up the exact name of the ISR in startup/startup_stm32.s and
      copy it into the recommended spot in your main.s.  (Yes, it has
      a long, strange name that you will understand the reasons for
      later.)  Designate it as a Thumb function, and make it global.
      It should do the following things:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Normal ISRs must <em>acknowledge</em> an interrupt so that
          it will not be immediately reinvoked.  To acknowledge a
          basic timer interrupt, you must write a zero to the UIF bit
          of the status register (SR) of the timer.  Sometimes,
          interrupts must be acknowledged by writing a '1' bit as you
          saw for the EXTI subsystem.  In this case, you write a '0'
          bit to the UIF bit to clear it, and write all other bits to
          '1' to avoid clearing anything else.  In other words, you
          write the bitwise inverse of TIM_SR_UIF, which is
          ~TIM_SR_UIF.  There will be no other bits set in the TIM6_SR
          register, so you may simply write 32 bits of zeros to the
          TIM6_SR register.  It will do what you need and not cause
          any other problems.  Be prepared to be more selective with
          peripheral status registers in future lab experiments.</li>
        <li>Toggle the PC8 bit.  To do so, you should check the
          current value of bit 8 of the ODR.  If it is set, use the
          BRR register to turn it off.  Otherwise, use the BSRR
          register to turn it on.  Avoid writing directly to the ODR.
          Multiple ISRs will modify pins of GPIOC, so it is important
          to use <i>atomic</i> operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This is the simplest way that you can demonstrate any timer:
      Write the simplest possible ISR, and blink one LED.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="setup_tim6">2.1.3: setup_tim6: Configure a basic timer</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have written a simple ISR for the Timer 6
      interrupt, you can configure timer 6 to invoke that interrupt.
      Write a subroutine named <b><code>setup_tim6</code></b> that
      does the following: (See the lecture notes for an example.)
      </p><ul>
        <li>Enables the RCC clock to Timer 6.  It is up to you to
          determine how to do so.  You might look at Section 7.4 of
          the Family Reference Manual to find which bits of which
          register (usually, one of AHBENR, APB1ENR, or APB2ENR) to
          set.  You can also look it up in the I/O Register browser in
          SystemWorkbench.  Practice doing so.  You will need to know
          how to do this for a lab practical.
        </li>
        <li>Configure TIM6_PSC to <em>prescale</em> the system clock
          by 48000.  (You should know, by now, that you should not
          write the value 48000 to the PSC register to do this.)  This
          will divide the 48 MHz system clock by 48000 to send a 1 kHz
          clock to the free-running counter of the timer.
        </li>
        <li>Configure the Timer 6 auto-reload register (TIM6_ARR) to
          have a counting period of 500.  With an input clock of 1
          kHz, this will cause a timer update event to occur every 0.5
          seconds.  Since we intend to raise an interrupt that will
          run the ISR you just wrote, it will cause the PC6 LED to
          toggle every 0.5 seconds (or blink at a rate of 1 Hz).
        </li>
        <li>
          Configure the Timer 6 DMA/Interrupt Enable Register
          (TIM6_DIER) to enable the UIE flag (use the symbol
          TIM_DIER_UIE for this).  This will enable an update
          interrupt to occur each time the free-running counter of the
          timer reaches the ARR value and starts back at zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable Timer 6 to start counting by setting the CEN bit in
          the Timer 6 Control Register 1.  (Set TIM_CR1_CEN in
          TIM6_CR1.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable the interrupt for Timer 6 in the NVIC ISER in a
          manner similar to how you did in lab 4.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Once you complete this subroutine and run it, you will see the
      PC8 (Green) LED blink at a rate of 1 Hz.
    <p></p>


    <h3 id="initial_steps">2.2 A display multiplexing and key scanning
    application</h3>
    <p>
      Once you've successfully written a timer ISR, more interesting
      applications are easy to implement.  Rather than add them to the
      ISR you just wrote, you'll write an ISR for a second timer and a
      configuration subroutine that will turn off Timer 6.  This will
      allow the code you just wrote to be tested independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application to be built for this lab is the lunar lander game
      that you may have seen in ECE 270.  You will use the concepts for
      this system, as well as the hardware it uses, for future lab
      experiments.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Data">2.2.1 Data structures for the application</h3>
    <p>
      Three very simple global "data structures" will be used to keep
      track of the values needed for this application.  They are already
      defined at the bottom of the main.s template file.
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <b><code>col</code></b> is a single-byte integer, with a
          value ranging from 0 – 7, that indicates the digit
          presently being displayed.  <b>AND</b> the lower two bits
          indicate the row that is being scanned.  For purposes of
          these subroutines, digits will be numbered, left-to-right 0
          – 7, and keypad columns will be numbered, right-to-left
          0 – 3.  For instance, if the value
          of <b><code>col</code></b> is 6, that would mean that
          digit 6 (second from the right) is illuminated, and that column
          2 (containing buttons 2, 5, 8, and 0) is being scanned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>disp</code></b> is a 9-entry array of
          single-byte values, each of which represent the characters to
          display for each digit.  The entries for this array should be
          pre-initialized to the following values:
          <b><pre>  disp: .string "Hello..."</pre></b>
          This string will be shown on the seven-segment displays on startup.
          <br>
          You might be saying "I only count eight characters there.
          Why do you say nine?"  Remember that every string is
          terminated by a NUL (zero) byte.  If you write a quoted
          string with eight characters in it, nine bytes of space
          are allocated.  This will be important for us when we write
          messages into the string with sprintf.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>mode</code></b> is a one-byte value that determines
          what information is to be shown on the seven segment displays.
          We'll store a <i>character</i> value here to help us remember
          what the mode means.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>thrust</code></b> is a one-byte value that indicates
          the last specified throttle setting.  It will always have a
          numeric value of 0 to 9.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>fuel</code></b> is a two-byte (halfword) value that
          indicates the remaining amount of fuel for the lunar lander.
          It is initialized with the value 800 (decimal).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>alt</code></b> is a two-byte (halfword) value that
          indicates how far about the lunar surface the lander is.
          It is initialized with the value 4500 (decimal).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b><code>velo</code></b> is a two-byte (halfword) value that
          indicates the current velocity of the lander.  We choose to
          represent velocities that decrease altitude as negative
          values.  Since the lander is falling toward the lunar
          surface, the value of velo will normally be negative.  The
          initial value of velo is zero.  Gravity will gradually make
          it negative.
        </li>
      </ul>
      These variables are created and initialized at the bottom of
      your main.s file.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="show_char">2.2.2: show_char: Display a single character</h3>
    <p>
      Implement, in ARM Cortex-M0 assembly language, the following
      subroutine that will select a digit to light using PB8, PB9, and
      PB10 and also output the 8-bit pattern to display on that digit
      on PB0 – PB7.  A table provided for you gives the mapping
      from the character number to the segments of the LEDs to
      illuminate.  Such a data structure could arguably be called
      a <em>font</em> since it shows the elements of the data to
      display.  You can call it exactly that.
      The <b><code>font</code></b> array is in read-only memory (i.e., in
      the text segment) at the bottom of the text file.  It includes
      most of the printable ASCII character set, although some characters
      are not possible on a 7-segment LED (e.g., "m" and "w").
    </p><p>
    </p>
      To implement the subroutine, the pattern should be read from
      the <b><code>n</code></b>th element of
      the <b><code>font</code></b> array.  Since all of the Port B
      output pins are being used for the display, you may simply
      output the combined value to the ODR.  Note that, as a defensive
      coding practice, you should ensure that the offset value is in
      the range of 0 – 7.
      <pre>        void show_char(int n, char c)
        {
            n = n &amp; 7;
            GPIOB-&gt;ODR = (n &lt;&lt; 8) | font[c];
        }
      </pre>
      Note that <b><code>font</code></b> is an array of single-byte
      values.  You should use the single-byte load instruction
      when reading its values.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="fill_alpha">2.2.2.1: fill_alpha: Show sequential letters</h3>
    <p>
      Once you implement <b><code>show_char</code></b>, you may uncomment
      the call to <b><code>fill_alpha</code></b>, which is provided for you.
      It will call <b><code>show_char</code></b> with the values 'A' through
      'H' to show the series on the display.  You may use this for debugging.
      Once it is working, show your TA to confirm that you have completed
      this much of the lab experiment.  You will not receive credit for the
      remainder of the lab if you cannot demonstrate this much in lab.
    </p>

    <h3 id="drive_column">2.2.3: drive_column: Update the keypad column being scanned</h3>
    <p>
      Implement the following subroutine that updates the column of the
      keypad that has a logic high applied to it.  Remember that the
      column being scanned is the least two significant bits of the
      <b><code>col</code></b> variable.  Not all of the pins of
      Port C configured for output are used for the same
      thing.  One of them is for blinking PC8.
      You should not simply write to the ODR to implement this
      subroutine.  Use the BSRR register to update only the
      bits 4 – 7, like this:
      </p><pre>        void drive_column(int c)
        {
            int c = c &amp; 3;
            GPIOC-&gt;BSRR = 0xf00000 | (1 &lt;&lt; (c + 4));
        }
      </pre>
      Remember that the upper 16 bits of BSRR clear pins and the lower 16
      bit set pins.  Setting takes precedence over clearing.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="scan_keypad">2.3: Implement keypad scanning</h3>
    <p>
      For the next three substeps, you will implement keypad scanning.
    </p>


    <h3 id="read_rows">2.3.1: read_rows: Read the row values</h3>
    <p>
      Implement the following function to examine the IDR of Port C
      and return the 4-bit reading of the columns of the keypad.
      </p><pre>        int read_rows()
        {
            return GPIOC-&gt;IDR &amp; 0xf;
        }
      </pre>
      In other words, bits 3 – 0 of R0 should hold the four
      bits read from PC3 – PC0.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="rows_to_key">2.3.2: rows_to_key: Translate row of a column to a key</h3>
    <p>
      Implement the following function that examines the rows reading
      for a particular column and turns it into a character.  Remember
      that only the lower two bits of the <b><code>col</code></b> determine
      the column.  We want to turn the row/column combination into a
      number and then use that number as the offset into an array called
      the <b><code>keymap</code></b> that is initialized for you in main.s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keypad columns are scanned from right-to-left, where the
      rightmost column is column 0 and the leftmost column is column
      3.  Rows are interpreted from bottom-to-top.
      </p><pre>        Buttons:                 Offsets:
        +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+
        | 1 | 2 | 3 | A |        | f | b | 7 | 3 |
        +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+
        | 4 | 5 | 6 | B |        | e | a | 6 | 2 |
        +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+
        | 7 | 8 | 9 | C |        | d | 9 | 5 | 1 |
        +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+
        | * | 0 | # | D |        | c | 8 | 4 | 0 |
        +---+---+---+---+        +---+---+---+---+
      </pre>
      For instance, if the '8' button is pressed, the number for that
      button should be 0x9 (an offset of one from the start of column
      2: 2*4 + 1 = 9).  When the '*' button is pressed, the offset
      should be 12 (hexadcimal 0xc) since it is in column 3, row 0
      (3*4 + 0 = 12).
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The function to implement is:
      </p><pre>        char rows_to_key(int rows) {
            int n = (col &amp; 0x3) * 4; // or int n = (col &lt;&lt; 30) &gt;&gt; 28;
            do {
                if (rows &amp; 1)
                    break;
                n ++;
                rows = rows &gt;&gt; 1;
            } while(rows != 0);
            char c = keymap[n];
            return c;
        }
      </pre>
      This function returns a char.  Really, all that means is that only the
      lower eight bits of R0 will be significant.  R0 is still a 32-bit
      register, and it is still used as the return value.
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="handle_key">2.3.3: handle_key: Do something for a particular key</h3>
    <p>
      Implement the following function that decides what to do for a key
      passed as an argument.  The function to implement is:
      </p><pre>        void handle_key(char key)
        {
            if (key == 'A' || key == 'B' || key == 'D')
                mode = key;
            else if (key &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; key &lt;= '9')
                thrust = key - '0';
        }
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="TIM7_ISR">2.3.4: Timer 7 ISR</h3>
    <p>
      Write an ISR for timer 7.  You should look up the exact name for
      it in startup/startup_stm32.s, declare it to be a Thumb
      function, and make it global.  The ISR should first acknowledge
      the timer interrupt (similar to what you did for the timer 6
      ISR).  Then, it should do the following things to invoke the
      subroutines you just wrote:
      </p><pre>        int rows = read_rows();
        if (rows != 0) {
            char key = rows_to_key(rows);
            handle_key(key);
        }
        char ch = disp[col];
        show_char(col, ch);
        col = (col + 1) &amp; 7;
        drive_column(col);
      </pre>
      You may, of course, omit the temporary variable used between
      the calls to read_rows() and update_history().  In assembly language,
      you can just use the R0 register.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Remember that <b><code>col</code></b> is a single-byte integer.
      You should not use <b><code>ldr</code></b>
      or <b><code>str</code></b> to access it.  Use the single-byte
      load and store instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, read_rows() is called, and update_history() is called.
      The col value is incremented, and then
      drive_column() is called.  This is a non-intuitive order of events,
      and it often confuses students.  The reason we do not call
      drive_column() and then immediately call read_rows() is because it
      sometimes takes a little time for current to flow into the row
      of buttons and <em>settle out</em> to be read properly on the
      input pins.  It doesn't always happen, but when students energize the
      column and immediately try to read the rows, and
      it <em>doesn't</em> work, then it's a Bad Day ™.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't want that to happen to you, and neither do we.  Here,
      you don't get to choose.  You must call the functions in the
      order shown above.  Otherwise autotest won't count it as
      correct.
    </p>

    <h3 id="setup_tim7">2.3.5: setup_tim7: Configure timer 7</h3>
    <p>
      Write a subroutine to enable and configure timer 7.  This will
      be similar to the subroutine you wrote to configure timer 6.
      Remember that timer 6 was written as a simple test, and it
      interferes with everything you've written since then (because it
      updates PC6).  This is the point where you must disable timer 6.
      Here are the things you need to do:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Enable the RCC clock for TIM7.  You must look up how to do this
          so that you will be prepared for a lab practical.</li>
        <li>Set the Prescaler and Auto-Reload Register to result in a
          timer update event exactly once per millisecond.  (i.e., a
          frequency of 1 kHz)</li>
        <li>Enable the UIE bit in the DIER.</li>
        <li>Enable the Timer 7 interrupt in the NVIC ISER.</li>
        <li><!--font color="red"-->Set the CEN bit in TIM7_CR1<!--/font--><br>
      </li></ul>
      Note that another common mistake made by students is to set
      the TIM7_ARR register to zero.  When you do that, the timer
      won't do anything.  That's worth a bigger warning...
    <p></p>


    <div class="attention">
      <p>
        <img src="./ECE 362 Lab Experiment 5_files/warning-sign-small.png" style="float: left; width: 6em; margin-right: 1em">
        If you set the Auto-Reload Register of a timer to zero, the
        timer won't do anything.  If you're tempted to do that, divide
        the prescaler setting by a certain amount and multiply the
        desired timer counter period by the same amount.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Once you are done with this subroutine, uncomment the call to it
      in the main subroutine. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Debugging tip:</b> It is often helpful to slow down the rate
      of interrupts to <em>human speed</em> to better understand what
      is going on.  For instance, if you set the timer 7 rate to one
      interrupt per second, you'll be able to see exactly what is
      happening.  You should see individual digits displayed for one
      second at a time on the LED displays.  You'll be able to press
      buttons at exactly the right time to be detected
      by <b><code>read_rows</code></b>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="write_display">2.4.1: write_display: Write a formatted message on the display</h3>
    <p>
      The subroutines written above will be used to show characters on the
      display and scan the keypad.  They are called by the timer 7
      ISR.  Any update to the <b><code>disp</code></b> array will be
      immediately copied to the 7-segment LEDs a thousand times per
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, there is nothing to <em>interpret</em> or use the keypad
      events to change the display.  It just says "Hello..."  Now, you
      will write a function called <b><code>write_display</code></b>
      that will check the
      <b><code>mode</code></b> variable, and write a message into the
      <b><code>disp</code></b> array based on the selected mode.  For
      instance, when we press the 'A' key, the display should show the
      altitude.  When we press the 'B' key, it should show the current
      fuel level.  When we press the 'D' key, it should show the speed
      of descent.  If we make a soft landing, the display should show
      "Landed" and if we make a hard landing, it should display "Crashed".
    </p>

    <p>
      To update the disp array, we will use
      the <b><code>snprintf</code></b> library function that is
      provided in the standard peripheral library.  That will allow us
      to easily turn integer values into character strings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The subroutine to implement is as follows:
      </p><pre>        void write_display(void)
        {
            if (mode == 'C')
                snprintf(disp, 9, "Crashed");
            else if (mode == 'L')
                snprintf(disp, 9, "Landed "); // Note the extra space!
            else if (mode == 'A')
                snprintf(disp, 9, "ALt%5d", alt);
            else if (mode == 'B')
                snprintf(disp, 9, "FUEL %3d", fuel);
            else if (mode == 'D')
                snprintf(disp, 9, "Spd %4d", velo);
        }
      </pre>
      Important notes:
      <ul>
        <li> <b><code>alt</code></b>, <b><code>fuel</code></b>,
          and <b><code>velo</code></b> are each 16-bit integers.  When
          you load their values into the appropriate registers to pass
          them to snprintf, you should take care to load them
          appropriately.  The <b><code>velo</code></b> variable is
          tricky since it is usually negative (our convention is that
          downward motion is the negative direction).  You should be
          sure to used a signed halfword load or do an unsigned
          halfword load and sign-extend the halfword to a 32-bit
          quantity.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you write instructions to compare
          the <b><code>mode</code></b> value, you can use character
          constants directly without looking up ASCII values.  For instance,
          if you want to know if register R0 contains the letter 'A', you
          may do so like this:
          <pre>            cmp r0,#'A'
          </pre>
          In C as well as assembly language, a single-quoted character
          is actually treated like an 8-bit integer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Each time <b><code>write_display</code></b> is called, it will
      overwrite the previous contents of the <b><code>disp</code></b>
      array.  The code invoked by the timer 7 interrupt will copy it
      to the 7-segment displays.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
      Instead of the na&iuml;ve approach, we recognize two things:
      <nl>
        <li>
          The history array entries will only be updated by an
          interrupt.  It is only necessary to check the history array
          after each interrupt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every key that is pressed must be released.  If we wait for
          each key to be released before we accept another key pressed
          we can avoid the situation where multiple interrupts occur
          while a key is pressed for a first time.
        </li>
      </nl>
      Therefore, the subroutine should, instead, wait for the
      conclusion of an interrupt, then scan the history bytes for the
      requested state.  How can we <u>W</u>ait <u>F</u>or
      an <u>I</u>nterrupt?  By using the WFI instruction:
      <pre>
        int wait_for(int state)
        {
            for(;;) {
                asm volatile ("wfi" : :);   // wait for an interrupt
                for(int i=0; i &lt; 16; i++)
                    if (hist[i] == state)
                        return i;
            }
        }
      </pre>
      The <b><code>asm volatile ("wfi" : :);</code></b> is simply the
      means by which we can embed a WFI instruction into a C program.
      (See the lecture on embedded C for more information.)  When
      writing an assembly language program, you can just type "wfi".
      When the CPU executes the WFI instruction, it will put the
      microcontroller into <em>sleep mode</em>.  This is a low-power
      state that is useful for reducing power consumption.  Although
      the CPU is asleep, the peripheral subsystems that have been
      enabled continue to run.  The CPU is awakened from sleep mode by
      an interrupt to run the ISR.  When the ISR returns, the code
      following the WFI instruction is executed.  In this way, the
      code to evaluate the history array can only happen after an ISR
      completes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The important thing to recognize is that this subroutine runs
      in the context of the <em>main program</em> of the application,
      and it does not return until an interrupt has happened, and the
      conditions of the history array constitute a button press.
    </p>

    <h3 id="update_variables">2.4.2: update_variables: Compute altitude, velocity, and acceleration</h3>
    <p>
      Implement a subroutine to update the variables that describe the
      lunar lander.  First the code.  Then an explanation:
      </p><pre>        void update_variables(void)
        {
            fuel -= thrust;
            if (fuel &lt;= 0) {
                thrust = 0;
                fuel = 0;
            }

            alt += velo;
            if (alt &lt;= 0) { // we've reached the surface
                if (-velo &lt; 10)
                    mode = 'L'; // soft landing
                else
                    mode = 'C'; // crash landing
                return;
            }

            velo += thrust - 5;
        }
      </pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This subroutine will be called periodically.  For each time period,
      an amount of fuel determined by the thrust is deducted from the
      fuel supply.  When the fuel reaches zero (or less), there can be no more
      thrust, so the thrust and the fuel level are set to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time this subroutine is called, the current velocity
      (<b><code>velo</code></b>) is added to the altitude
      (<b><code>alt</code></b>).  You can think of this as a form
      of discrete <i>integration</i>.  Velocity is the derivative of
      distance per unit of time.  Distance is the summation of velocity
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the altitude is zero (or less), we've reached the lunar
      surface.  We have to check the velocity to determine what kind
      of landing it was.  If the speed was less than 10, we'll
      consider it a successful landing.  Otherwise, we'll consider it
      to be a crash landing.  Remember that the velocity will be negative
      at the time of a landing, so we need to negate when we compare it
      to 10.  <b>Once landed/crashed, we do not want to make further
        veclocity calculations, so the subroutine should return.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the new velocity (<b><code>velo</code></b>) will the the
      summation of the accelerating forces on the lander.  Here, we'll
      integrate those forces.  The summed velocity will change by adding
      the thrust and subtracting the gravity (5).
    </p>
    <p>
      These calculations are all that are needed to determine the motion
      of the lander.  Note that we've deliberately avoided declaring
      <i>units</i> for any of the quantities we've described.  You can
      feel free to imagine that the velocity is meters per second,
      feet per minute, furlongs per fortnight, or any other metric you
      prefer.  The dimensions are not important so long as we have a
      playable game.
    </p>

    <h3 id="setup_tim14">2.4.3: Set up timer 14</h3>
    <p>
      To periodically invoke <b><code>update_variables</code></b>
      and <b><code>write_display</code></b>, create an ISR for timer 14.
      In it, do the following:
      </p><pre>        void ISR(void) {
            // remember to acknowledge the interrupt
            update_variables();
            write_display();
        }
      </pre>
      And then create a subroutine named <b><code>setup_tim14</code></b>
      to initialize Timer 14 to invoke an update interrupt twice per
      second (2 Hz).
    <p></p>

    <p>
      At this point, you should have a playable game.

      This university has a long history of producing graduates who
      are able land on the moon.  Once your program works, you may
      want a strategy to be equally successful.  Here is one:
      <nl>
        </nl></p><li>When the program starts, the altitude is 4500, and the
          thrust is zero, so the lander goes into a free fall.
          Continue to monitor the altitude.
        </li>
        <li>
          The moment the altitude drops to 3000, press '8' to slow
          the descent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press 'D' to monitor the rate of descent.  The speed shown
          should reduce in magnitude from -119.  When it is less than
          -10, press '5' so that the thrust matches the force of
          gravity.  The velocity will remain the same for the
          remainder of the descent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press 'A' again to watch the altitude.  There should be
          enough remaining fuel to have a controlled descent and soft
          landing.
        </li>
