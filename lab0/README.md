# ECE 362 Lab Experiment 0: Getting Started
## Introduction
In ECE362, students will learn fundamentals of microcontrollers, including their operation, and usage. In addition to the lecture portion of the course, students are expected to complete a series of lab experiments using a microcontroller platform and IDE. Computers and measurement equipment are provided in the course laboratory facilities to assist students in completing labs, however, the course has also been designed to allow students to perform experiment exercises on their own computers at home or elsewhere. Instructions provided in this lab document serves as a guide to setting up the microcontroller development environment used in ECE362 to provide a consistent user experience between home and the laboratory.

## Instructional Objectives
- To become familiar with the contents of the ECE 362 lab kit
- To learn how to install the SystemWorkbench IDE on your personal computer
- To practice building a project, running a program on the microcontroller, and debugging execution

## Note:
a pain to format bc there are A LOT of pictures so no.

Lab 0 is just setting up the microcontroller on board and creating a project and then run the debugger.
