## List of Lab Assignments
- **lab0**: Getting Started
  - In ECE362, students will learn fundamentals of microcontrollers, including their operation, and usage. In addition to the lecture portion of the course, students are expected to complete a series of lab experiments using a microcontroller platform and IDE. Computers and measurement equipment are provided in the course laboratory facilities to assist students in completing labs, however, the course has also been designed to allow students to perform experiment exercises on their own computers at home or elsewhere. Instructions provided in this lab document serves as a guide to setting up the microcontroller development environment used in ECE362 to provide a consistent user experience between home and the laboratory.   
- **lab1**: First Blinks
  - Traditionally, the "first steps" taken to verify that a microcontroller works and that you know how to use it, is to make a light blink. In this introductory exercise, you will use an integrated development environment (IDE) to interact with a microcontroller. You will type in, compile, and debug a few programs that we have prepared for you. One of the programs will cause the built-in LEDs of the STM32F091 development board to blink. You will also write a few simple assembly language subroutines.  
  Now that you know that the hardware in your lab kit works, you are comfortable with creating projects, and you've had some experience typing in programs, you will be expected to complete this lab autonomously. If you need help, ask a teaching assistant. In lab, you will receive help for and be checked off for subroutines that you complete. You will also be given a module that will evaluate the subroutines. It will generate a completion code on the serial port as with Lab 0.
- **lab2**: Assembly Language Programming
  - Now that you know how to use an Integrated Development Environment and use assembly instructions, it is time to actually do some programming. In the prelab assignment, you will test your knowledge of how various instructions actually work. For the in-lab experiment, you will write short assembly language programs that perform simple tasks.  
  Now that you know that the hardware in your lab kit works, you are comfortable with creating projects, and you've had some experience typing in programs, you will be expected to complete this lab autonomously. If you need help, ask a teaching assistant. This lab will also not need to be evaluated when you finish it. You will receive a completion code on the serial port as you did with Lab 0.
- **lab3**: General Purpose I/O
  - In this experiment, you will learn how to connect simple input devices (push buttons and keypad) and simple output devices (LEDs) to an STM32 development board. You will learn how to configure the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) subsystems. You will read values from and write values to these pins.
