<p>This is the <em>get-to-know-you</em> homework.  There is
no grade for this homework, but <b>you do need to complete it satisfactorily
if you want to get a non-zero grade for any assignment after this.</b>
We'll also consider a few of the things that you write here for potential
bonus credit.  If you do not complete this homework satisfactorily, you
will not receive bonus credit.
</p><p>This homework will also familiarize you with the assignment submission
system that you will use for all work in this class.  Here's what you need
to know:
</p><ul>
<li>Students are often surprised when there is no need to log in to submit
    work.  You have logged in to be able to see the assignment, and those
    credentials are used for submission as well.
</li><li>To save your answers, press any one of the "Save" buttons on the page.
    All answers are saved by pressing any "Save" button.
    You may change your answers and save your work as many times as you
    want before the due date.
</li><li>At the top of the page is a due date.  Pay close attention to that.
    You might be typing away at homework or a post-lab submission with
    no indication that time has run out---until you press "Save".
    You will not be able to submit answers after the due date.  You
    won't find that out until it's too late.  Save early.  Save often.
</li><li> Most assignments have a <em>weight</em> shown at the top of the page
     that indicates its relative worth compared to other assignments.
     A homework assignment might have a weight of 1.  A lab might have
     a weight of 2.  An exam might have a weight of 5.  This assignment
     has a weight of zero, so it's not shown.  Despite the fact that
     there are points for this assignment, it doesn't directly affect
     your grade.  It will affect your eligibility for bonus points though.

</li><li>On almost everything you turn in, there is an academic integrity
    statement where you are expected to type your name.  Fill that out
    first.  For most assignments, you can leave that blank to
    conveniently indicate to the course staff that you want to receive
    a zero score for the work in question.

</li><li> As the assignment is graded, you will see the progress of that
     grading.  As points are graded an indicator at the top of the page
     will show that x/y points have been graded and and w/z penalties
     have been graded.  When it says that penalties being graded,
     it doesn't mean you've received a penalty.  It only means that
     the decision as to whether a penalty should be applied or not has
     been made.  If you see something that would result in a penalty
     (like forgetting to fill something in), you should contact your TA
     to resolve the oversight before grading is completed.

</li></ul>

<br><hr>
<h2>Full Name [0 ... -1 points]</h2>
<p>
Enter your full name.  Don't make a mistake.
We'll compare this name against every other assignment you submit
when we remind you about academic integrity.  This is an example
of an answer that has no points, but has penalties possible.
The idea is that, if you decide you need to do something unethical
for the assignment, you can omit your name and forfeit all
points for the assignment as well as be granted immunity from
an academic dishonesty charge.

What is your level of interest in this class?  (It's totally okay

you're required to.  If that's the case, we'll still try to make it as
informative and enjoyable as possible.)

<h2>Background [10 ... -100 points]</h2>
<p>

Tell us something about yourself that you want the course staff to know.
We're not looking for something <em>embarrassing</em> here---maybe just a
summary of your interests and hobbies.  (This is an example of
something we're going to look at when we're considering rounding up your
grade at the end of the semester.  If you write something short and trivial
here, you can expect to not get much in the way of rounding up.)

I love having academic conversations with different people and diversifying my experiences and skills through networking and putting my hands on projects. This has pushed me to be the adaptable and curious individual I am now. 

I am skilled in C and python programming, systemVerilog, and design and simulation softwares such as MATLAB and Simulink. I have experience in robotics, SolidWorks, and PCB and electrical schematic softwares such as Eagle and LTspice. 

I also love cats but have a pet bunny.</textarea>

<h2>Can potential employers contact you?</h2>
<p>

Sometimes, the course staff is contacted by other persons in the university
who are looking for potential employees.  For instance, someone might ask
us if any of our students are good COBOL programmers.  It's easy enough to
search the student background submissions for the word "COBOL" to find
anyone that mentioned it and put them in contact with you.
<br>
<br>
You might not want to be bothered.  In particular, if anyone really wanted
to find a COBOL programmer, you should probably run very far away.
<br>
<br>
Should we contact you about employment searches?

<h2>Understanding Course Policies</h2>
<p>
Please read over the
<a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/about/pols_and_pros.pdf">
Course Policies and Procedures</a>, the
<a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/about/lab_policy.pdf">
Lab Policies and Procedures</a>, and the
<a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/about/lab_rules_and_regs.pdf">
Lab Rules and Regulations</a> documents.
Be sure that you are familiar with them.
If you have any questions about the policies for the course,
you may ask them at any time.  For now, please type 'I understand'
(without the quotes or any other punctuation or additional spaces)
into the text box below to indicate that you have read and understand
these documents.
</p><p>
Read carefully before filling in your answer.  If an occasion should
occur that the course staff need to talk to you about some problem, we
will refer back to your answer to this statement.  You must, nevertheless,
answer it correctly in order to be allowed to submit most future assignments.
(As with so many things in life, you do not need to agree with everything.
You do need to accept them though.)
